Two groups (moderately halophilic Methanohalophilus strains and extremely halophilic Methanohalobium strains) were formed on the basis of G+ C contents and DNA-DNA hybridization data. Type strain SLP of Methanohalophilus mahii and type strain 2-7982 of Methanococcus halophilus exhibited 87{\%} sequence similarity and belong to the same genus (Methanohalophilus), if not to the same species. A regulation of the International Code of Nomenclature of BacteriQ implies that the specific epithet halophilus has priority by validation and should be retained. Therefore, we propose that Methanococcus halophilus should be transferred to the genus Methanohalophilus as Methanohalophilus halophilus comb. nov. (type strain, strain 2-7982 [= DSM 3094 = OCM 1601); an emended description is given. Moderately halophilic strains TR-7, 2-7404, and 2-7405, which were isolated from geographically separated sites, exhibited high levels of DNA-DNA hybridization with Methanohalophilus mahii and might be regarded as strains of the same Methanohalophilus species. The alkaliphilic organism Methanohalophilus zhilinae is a valid species in the genus Methanohalophilus. The extremely halophilic organism Methanohalobium evestigatum exhibited no significant DNA-DN A hybridization with moderately halophilic species and should be regarded as a member of an independent genus. Other extremely halophilic strains (strains 2-7408 and 2-7403) exhibited low levels of DNA-DNA hybridization with Methanohalobium evestigatum Z-7303T (= DSM 3721) (T = type strain).},

Cells were wavy rods (11-62 $\mu$m long) with blunt tapered ends and Gram-negative stained. Strain X-18T grew strict anaerobically and produced methane exclusively from H2/CO2. Growth occurred in the temperature range of 4-32 °C and optimally at 25 °C. Growth pH ranged from 6.5-8.0 and optimally at 7.0. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain X-18T was 44.4 mol{\%}. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase indicated that strain X-18T affiliated to the genus Methanospirillium, and was most related to Methanospirillum lacunae Ki8-1T at 96.3{\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. However, strain X-18T was distinguished from the existing Methanospirillium spp. by the lower growth temperature and obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic analysis, strain X-18T can represent a novel species of the genus Methanospirillum, for which Methanospirillum psychrodurum sp. nov. is proposed and strain X-18T is assigned as the type strain (=CGMCC 1.5186T=JCM 19216T).},

abstract = {Nitrogen fixation (diazotrophy) has recently been demonstrated in several methanogenic archaebacteria. To compare the process in an archaebacterium with that in eubacteria, we examined the properties of diazotrophic growth and nitrogenase activity in Methanosarcina barkeri 227. Growth yields with methanol or acetate as a growth substrate were significantly lower in N(2)-grown cultures than in NH(4)-grown cultures, and the culture doubling times were increased, indicating that diazotrophy was energetically costly, as it is in eubacteria. Growth of nitrogen-fixing cells was inhibited when molybdenum was omitted from the medium; addition of 10 nM molybdate stimulated growth, while 1 muM molybdate restored maximum diazotrophic growth. Omission of molybdenum did not inhibit growth of ammonia-grown cells. Tungstate (100 muM) strongly inhibited growth of molybdenum-deficient diazotrophic cells, while ammonia-grown cells were unaffected. The addition of 100 nM vanadate or chromate did not stimulate diazotrophic growth of molybdenum-starved cells. These results are consistent with the presence of a molybdenum-containing nitrogenase in M. barkeri. Acetylene, the usual substrate for assaying nitrogenase activity, inhibited methanogenesis by M. barkeri and consequently needed to be used at a low partial pressure (0.3{\%} of the headspace) when acetylene reduction by whole cells was assayed. Whole cells reduced 0.3{\%} acetylene to ethylene at a very low rate (1 to 2 nmol h mg of protein), and they "switched off" acetylene reduction in response to added ammonia or glutamine. Crude extracts from diazotrophic cells reduced 10{\%} acetylene at a rate of 4 to 5 nmol of C(2)H(4) formed h mg of protein when supplied with ATP and reducing power, while extracts of Klebsiella pneumoniae prepared by the same procedures had rates 100-fold higher. Acetylene reduction by extracts required ATP and was completely inhibited by 1 mM ADP in the presence of 5 mM ATP. The low rates of C(2)H(2) reduction could be due to improper assay conditions, to switched-off enzyme, or to the nitrogenase's having lower activity towards acetylene than towards dinitrogen.},

It allowed much larger numbers of colonies to be counted and isolated with greater ease from a given volume of medium and after longer incubation periods. The main modifications made were the use of rumen fluid clarified by centrifugation, reducing the concentration of the sugar energy sources (glucose and cellobiose) and inclusion of soluble starch as an additional energy source, and changing the reducing agent from cysteine to a combination of cysteine and sodium sulfide. Many other modifications in the medium were tested and found to be without effect or detrimental to colony counts. Experiments indicate that about the same range of species of bacteria are cultured in the improved medium as in the old, except that the improved medium allows the growth of bacteroides strains that utilize starch but not glucose or cellobiose. Significant differences were shown in nonselective viable counts of ruminal bacteria obtained from samples of rumen contents collected at different times during the day from a cow fed alfalfa hay or a grain mixture once a day, and there were also differences in counts due to the ration},

abstract = {Populations of the four major trophic groups of methanogens were enumerated by most probable numbers (MPN) on selective media in a sample of 13 soils representative of major types of rice soils. Dominant strains were isolated and their phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics were studied. MPN counts ranged from 102 to 106 g-1 d.w. on H2, from {\textless} 10 to 104 g-1 d.w. on acetate, from {\textless}10 to 105 on methanol, and from 50 to 106 on formate. In most soils, counts of hydrogenotrophs were higher than counts of acetotrophs, partly because acetotrophs were aggregated sarcinae difficult to separate into individual cells. Methylotrophs other than acetotrophic sarcinae were not recorded. In most soils, rods enumerated on formate were 5-400 times less abundant than those enumerated on H2, indicating that hydrogenotrophic-non-formatotrophic rods are probably dominant in ricefields. Dominant strains isolated comprised: 15 hydrogenotrophic-non-formatotrophic rods affiliated to Methanobacterium bryantii; three hydrogenotrophic-formatotrophic rods affiliated to Mb. formicicum; one hydrogenotrophic-formatotrophic rod not affiliated to a sequenced species; two sarcinae affiliated so far isolated from marine sediments only. Results from classical counts of methanogens and strains isolated from ricefields suggest the dominance of Methanobacterium spp. (mostly responsible for CH4 production from H2/CO2) and Methanosarcina spp. (mostly responsible for CH4 production from acetate) among culturable organisms. Both genera are probably ubiquitous. In particular, Mb. bryantii was isolated fro 12 of the 13 soils.},

Acetate addition significantly enhanced the final cell yield. Growth of these strains was completely inhibited by either 0.6 g of sodium sulfide per liter or 31.0 of sodium chloride per liter, but growth was not inhibited by either 0.3 g of sodium sulfide per liter or 1.0 g of sodium sulfate per liter.

From the 236 extracted genome bins, it was remarkably found that the vast majority of them could only be characterized at high taxonomic levels. This result confirms that the biogas microbiome is comprised by a consortium of unknown species. A comparative analysis between the genome bins of the current study and those extracted from a previous metagenomic assembly demonstrated a similar phylogenetic distribution of the main taxa. Finally, this analysis led to the identification of a subset of common microbes that could be considered as the core essential group in biogas production.},

abstract = {A novel methanogenic archaeon, strain MC-15(T), was isolated from a floating biofilm on a sulphurous subsurface lake in Movile Cave (Mangalia, Romania). Cells were non-motile sarcina-like cocci with a diameter of 2-4 µm, occurring in aggregates. The strain was able to grow autotrophically on H2/CO2. Additionally, acetate, methanol, monomethylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine were utilized, but not formate or dimethyl sulfide. Trypticase peptone and yeast extract were not required for growth. Optimal growth was observed at 33 °C, pH 6.5 and a salt concentration of 0.05 M NaCl. The predominant membrane lipids of MC-15(T) were archaeol and hydroxyarchaeol phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol as well as hydroxyarchaeol phosphatidylserine and archaeol glycosaminyl phosphatidylinositol. The closely related species, Methanosarcina vacuolata and Methanosarcina horonobensis, had a similar composition of major membrane lipids to strain MC-15(T). The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain MC-15(T) was similar to those of Methanosarcina vacuolata DSM 1232(T) (sequence similarity 99.3{\%}), Methanosarcina horonobensis HB-1(T) (98.8{\%}), Methanosarcina barkeri DSM 800(T) (98.7{\%}) and Methanosarcina siciliae T4/M(T) (98.4{\%}). DNA-DNA hybridization revealed 43.3{\%} relatedness between strain MC-15(T) and Methanosarcina vacuolata DSM 1232(T). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 39.0 mol{\%}. Based on physiological, phenotypic and genotypic differences, strain MC-15(T) represents a novel species of the genus Methanosarcina, for which the name Methanosarcina spelaei sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MC-15(T) ( = DSM 26047(T) = JCM 18469(T)).},

abstract = {Anaerobic digestion is the default process for biological conversion of residue organics to renewable energy and biofuel in the form of methane. However, its scope of application is expanding, due to availability of new technologies, and the emerging drivers of energy and nutrient conservation and recovery. Here, we outline two of these new application areas, namely wastewater nutrient and energy recovery, and generation of value added chemicals through mixed culture biotechnology. There exist two options for nutrient and energy recovery from domestic wastewater: low energy mainline and partition-release-recovery. Both are heavily dependent on anaerobic digestion as an energy generating and nutrient release step, and have been enabled by new technologies such as low emission anaerobic membrane processes. The area of mixed culture biotechnology has been previously identified as a key industrial opportunity, but is now moving closer to application due application of existing and new technologies. As well as acting as a core technology option in bioproduction, anaerobic digestion has a key role in residual waste valorization and generation of energy for downstream processing. These new application areas and technologies are emerging simultaneously with substantial advances in knowledge of underlying mechanisms such as electron transfer, understanding of which is critical to development of the new application areas.},

abstract = {This study compared advanced anaerobic digestion combining two-phased anaerobic digestion (2PAD) with high pressure homogenization (HPH) pretreatment to conventional anaerobic digestion of municipal sludge at laboratory scale. The study began with examination of thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) solubilization due to HPH pretreatment at different pressure (0-12,000 psi) and chemical dose (0.009-0.036 g NaOH/g total solids). Homogenizing pressure was found as the most significant factor (p-value {\textless} 0.05) for increasing solubilization of particulate chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biopolymers in TWAS. Based on the preliminary results, a pretreatment with chemical dose of 0.009 g NaOH/g total solids and pressure of 12,000 psi was selected for digester studies. Upon acclimation of anaerobic inocula to pretreatments, a total number of twelve lab-scale digesters were operated under scenarios including single-stage (control), 2PAD, and HPH coupled with 2PAD (HPH + 2PAD) at sludge retention times (SRTs) of 20, 14 and 7 days. Between mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures, mesophilic digestion was found to benefit more from pretreatments. Relative (to control) improvements in methane yield and volatile solids (VS) removals increased noticeably as SRT was shortened from 20 to 14 and 7 days. HPH + 2PAD system was found to achieve the maximum methane production (0.61-1.32 L CH4/Ldigester-d) and VS removals (43-64{\%}). Thermophilic control, 2PAD and HPH + 2PAD systems resulted in significant pathogen removals meeting Class A biosolids requirements according to Organic Matter Recycling Regulations (OMRR) of British Columbia (BC) at 20 d SRT. Energy analysis indicated that all the digestion scenarios attained positive energy balance with 2PAD system operated at 20 d SRT producing the maximum net energy of 4.76 GJ/tonne CODadded.},

abstract = {A novel methanogen, Methanosarcina baltica GS1-AT, DSM 14042, JCM 11281, was isolated from sediment at a depth of 241 m in the Gotland Deep of the Baltic Sea. Cells were irregular, monopolar monotrichous flagellated cocci 1.5-3 microm in diameter often occurring in pairs or tetrads. The catabolic substrates used included methanol, methylated amines, and acetate, but not formate or H2/CO2. Growth was observed in a temperature range between 4 degrees and 27 degrees C with an optimum at 25 degrees C. The doubling time with methanol as substrate was 84 h at 25 degrees C, 120 h at 9 degrees C, and 167 h at 4 degrees C. The doubling time with acetate as substrate was 252 h at 25 degrees C and 425 h at 20 degrees C. After the transfer of methanol-grown cultures, long lag phases were observed that lasted 15-20 days at 25 degrees C and 25 days at 4 degrees -9 degrees C. The NaCl optimum for growth was 2{\%}-4{\%}, and the fastest growth occurred within a pH range of 6.5-7.5. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence revealed that the strain was phylogenetically related to Methanosarcina. The sequence similarity to described species of {\textless}95.7{\%} and its physiological properties distinguished strain GS1-A(T) from all described species of the genus Methanosarcina.},

abstract = {The variability in both inorganic and organic properties of biomass fuels is large. This paper discusses combustion-driven transformations and deposition of inorganic material found in solid fuels, with a focus on the formation of deposits and their properties. A small number of mechanisms is used to describe both the transformations and deposition. The discussion below outlines this mechanistic approach to describing the fate of inorganic material in solid fuels with a particular focus on the mechanisms of ash deposition. This mechanistic approach has the potential of embracing a large range of fuel variations, combustor types, and operating conditions without the need of developing extensive databases or testing procedures for each new situation. The approach has been successfully demonstrated for coal combustion, and examples from coal experiments will be used as illustrations. The same methodology and logic can be applied to biomass combustion. A comparison of coal and biomass is briefly presented, including the chemical structures and the modes of occurrence of inorganic material in the fuels. The major mechanisms of ash deposition during combustion of coal and biomass are related to the types of inorganic material in the fuel and the combustion conditions. The effects of fuel (biomass or coal) characteristics and combustor operating conditions on ash deposit properties such as tenacity, emissivity, thermal conductivity, morphology, strength, chemical composition, viscosity, and rate of growth are discussed. A mechanistic model describing ash deposition in solid-fuel combustors is presented and used to postulate characteristics of ash deposits formed in biomass combustors.},

Biomass-coal co-combustion represents a near-term, low-risk, low-cost, sustainable, renewable energy option that promises reduction in net CO2 emissions, reduction in SOx and often NOx emissions, and several societal benefits. Technical issues associated with cofiring include fuel supply, handling and storage challenges, potential increases in corrosion, decreases in overall efficiency, ash deposition issues, pollutant emissions, carbon burnout, impacts on ash marketing, impacts on SCR performance, and overall economics. Each of these issues has been investigated and this presentation summarizes the state-of-the-art in each area, both in the US and abroad. The focus is on fireside issues. While each of the issues can be significant, the conclusion is that biomass residues represent possibly the best (cheapest and lowest risk) renewable energy option for many power producers.},

Microcalorimetry revealed exothermic reactions with dependence on the activator alkalinity. The activation energy of the geopolymerization process was determined as 86.2kJ/mol. The X-ray diffraction analysis revealed no additional crystalline phases associated with geopolymer formation. Over several weeks, the (29)Si NMR spectrum testified a high degree of polymerization and Al penetration into the SiO(4) tetrahedra. The (23)Na NMR MAS spectrum hypothesized that sodium is bound in the form of Na(H(2)O)(n) rather than Na(+), thus causing efflorescence in a moisture-gradient environment. As and Cr(6+) are weakly bonded in the geopolymer matrix, while excellent immobilization of Zn(2+), Cu(2+), Cd(2+), and Cr(3+) are reported.},

Densification of these biomass feedstocks into briquettes/pellets would help reduce the problems and costs of bulk transportation, handling, and storage of biomass feedstocks. In this study, the role of the natural binders in corn stover and switchgrass to make durable particle-particle bonding in briquettes/pellets was investigated by micro-structural analyses. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of briquettes made by using a uniaxial piston-cylinder densification apparatus in the laboratory, briquettes made by using a pilot-scale roll-press briquetting machine, and pellets made by using a pilot-scale conventional ring-die pelleting machine were analysed. The SEM images showed that the bonding between particles was created mainly through solid bridges. The solid bridges between particles were made by natural binders in the biomass expressed during the densification process. UV auto-fluorescence images of briquettes and pellets further confirmed that the solid bridges were made mainly by natural binders such as lignin and protein. It was found that activating (softening) the natural binders using moisture and temperature in the range of glass transition is important to make durable particle-particle bonding.},

It is found that devolatilisation kinetic rate has a noticeable effects on the ignition time, peak flame temperature, CO and H2 emissions at the bed top and the proportion of char burned in the final stage (char burning only) of the combustion. However, it has only a minor effect on the other parameters.

The compositions of biomass among fuel types are variable, especially with respect to inorganic constituents important to the critical problems of fouling and slagging. Alkali and alkaline earth metals, in combination with other fuel elements such as silica and sulfur, and facilitated by the presence of chlorine, are responsible for many undesirable reactions in combustion furnaces and power boilers. Reductions in the concentrations of alkali metals and chlorine, created by leaching the elements from the fuel with water, yield remarkable improvements in ash fusion temperatures and confirm much of what is suggested regarding the nature of fouling by biomass fuels. Other influences of biomass composition are observed for the rates of combustion and pollutant emissions. Standardized engineering practices setting out protocols of analysis and interpretation may prove useful in reducing unfavorable impacts and industry costs, and further development is encouraged.},

abstract = {Cofiring, the practice of supplementing a base fuel with a dissimilar fuel, is an extension of fuel blending practices common to the solid fuels community. Recently, there has been considerable emphasis on cofiring biomass opportunity fuels with coal in pulverized coal (PC) and cyclone boilers owned and operated by electricity generating utilities in order to address such issues as potential portfolio standards, voluntary actions to reduce fossil CO2 emissions, customer service, and the generation of green power within the context of deregulation. Biomass fuels considered for cofiring include wood waste, short rotation woody crops, short rotation herbaceous crops (e.g., switchgrass), alfalfa stems, various types of manure, landfill gas and wastewater treatment gas. Of these, the solid biofuels such as sawdust, urban wood waste and switchgrass have received the most attention. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), along with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), GPU Genco, Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), Central and South West Utilities (C{\&}SW), Southern Company, Madison Gas {\&} Electric (MG{\&}E), New York State Electric and Gas (NYSEG) and others developed a concerted effort to commercialize direct combustion cofiring of biomass with coal. The USDOE joined the program with a cooperative agreement between the Federal Energy Technology Center (FETC) — now the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and EPRI; this agreement was extensively supported by the energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) element of USDOE. European cofiring programs also have been extensive and include gasification-based cofiring in Lahti, Finland and straw cofiring in Denmark. Three general techniques comprise the cofiring technology family: blending the biomass and coal in the fuel handling system and feeding that blend to the boiler; preparing the biomass fuel separately from coal, and injecting it into the boiler without impacting the conventional coal delivery system; and gasifying the biomass with subsequent combustion of the producer gas in either a boiler or a combined cycle combustion turbine (CCCT) generating plant. Commercialization has proceeded on the direct combustion approaches to cofiring, beginning with engineering and economic studies, parametric testing and the construction of demonstration projects. The direct combustion cofiring techniques are now ready for commercial deployment. This paper reviews the key projects, and details some of the influences of cofiring on the combustion process.},

Biomass is used to meet a variety of energy needs, including generating electricity, heating homes, fueling vehicles and providing process heat for industrial facilities. The conversion technologies for utilizing biomass can be separated into four basic categories: direct combustion processes, thermochemical processes, biochemical processes and agrochemical processes. Thermochemical conversion processes can be subdivided into gasification, pyrolysis, supercritical fluid extraction and direct liquefaction. Pyrolysis is the thermochemical process that converts biomass into liquid, charcoal and non-condensable gases, acetic acid, acetone and methanol by heating the biomass to about 750 K in the absence of air. If the purpose is to maximize the yield of liquid products resulting from biomass pyrolysis, a low temperature, high heating rate, short gas residence time process would be required. For high char production, a low temperature, low heating rate process would be chosen. If the purpose is to maximize the yield of fuel gas resulting from pyrolysis, a high temperature, low heating rate, long gas residence time process would be preferred.},

This paper estimates a potential of 9.0–13.5 EJ in 2050, which represents 17–30{\%} of projected total energy requirements. This depends on assumptions of available land areas, achievable yields and the amount of recoverable residues utilized. Greater environmental and net energy benefits can be derived from perennial and woody energy crops compared to annual arable crops as alternative feedstocks for fossil fuels.

abstract = {Devolatilization behavior of different coals and biomasses under heating conditions typical of conventional pyrolysis processes was investigated. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed on coals (with high and low volatile matter), biomasses (pine sawdust and dried sewage sludge) and coal–biomass blends with different weight ratios. The different behavior of coals and biomass fuels in the devolatilization process (different amount and nature of volatile species released, different rate of devolatilization and different reactivity of produced chars) was analyzed for abstracting kinetic data. In addition, analyses of coal–biomass blends revealed that in the operative conditions used (i.e. low heating rate 20°C/min and high nitrogen flowrate), primary reactions of the thermal decomposition of biomass fuels are not significantly affected by the presence of coal, and also coal does not seem to be influenced by the release of volatile matter from biomass. This led to the first conclusion that the weight loss of a blend can be obtained from the weighted sum of reference materials. Further, a kinetic analysis was performed in order to fit the experimental results and verify simple sub-models (namely, distribution activation energy model and lumped model) to be used in comprehensive combustion codes (computational fluid dynamic) assuring a major accuracy compared with SFOR model, but maintaining both simplicity and computational velocity. A quite good fitting was obtained for all materials and blends studied.},

abstract = {Alkali in the ash of annual crop biomass fuels creates serious fouling and slagging in conventional boilers. Even with the use of sorbents and other additives, power plants can fire only limited amounts of these fuels in combination with wood. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and the biomass power industry conducted eight full-scale firing tests and several laboratory experiments to study the nature and occurrence of deposits. The goal was to increase the quantities of these biofuels which can be used. This paper describes the results of the laboratory and power plant tests which included: tracking and analyzing fuels and deposits by various methods; recording operating conditions; and extensive laboratory testing. These analyses have advanced the understanding of the role of minerals in the combustion of biomass, and their occurrence in biofuels. Deposits occur as a result of the boiler design, fuel properties and boiler operation. The limited furnace volume and high flue gas exit temperatures of most biomass boilers promote slag or deposits from biofuels which contain significant amounts of alkali, sulfur or chlorine and silica. All annual growth, whether from urban tree trimmings, annual crops and residues or energy crops contains sufficient volatile alkali, 0.34 kg GJ− (0.8 lb MMBtu−1) or more, to melt in combustion or vaporize and condense on boiler tubes and refractory. Special boiler designs are required for annual crops, including grasses and straws. Addition of magnesium oxide and other additives may be necessary to inhibit alkali volatilization while burning these biofuels.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to give a comprehensive review of initiatives on biomass certification from different viewpoints of stakeholders, including national governments (such as The Netherlands, the UK, Belgium and Germany), the EC, NGOs, companies, and international bodies up until October 2007. Furthermore, opportunities and restrictions in the development of biomass certification are described, including international trade law limitations, lack of adequate methodologies, stakeholder involvement requirements and certification costs. Next, five different approaches for the implementation of a biomass certification system are compared and discussed. Main differences are the voluntary or mandatory character and the geographical extent of the proposed strategies in terms of biomass end-use. It is concluded that criteria to ensure the sustainable production of biomass are needed urgently. To some extent criteria categories can be covered using existing systems, but others (such as GHG and energy balances, changing land-use) require the development of new methodologies. A gradual development of certification systems with learning (through pilot studies and research) and expansion over time, linked to the development of advanced methodologies can provide valuable experience, and further improve the feasibility and reliability of biomass certification systems. However, better international coordination between initiatives is required to improve coherence and efficiency in the development of sustainable biomass certification systems, to avoid the proliferation of standards and to provide a clearer direction in the approach to be taken. Finally, next to certification, alternative policy tools should be considered as well to ensure sustainable biomass production.},

abstract = {Liberalizing the electricity industry and attempting to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases are the two dominant trends in European energy policy. The last-mentioned issue might require the contribution from renewable energy technologies, but at present most renewables cannot compete on their own with conventional technologies. Thus, it can be expected that if renewables must compete solely on market conditions alone this will slow down or even halt the development of new renewable capacity. One model in which additional payments to renewable technologies are generated is based on the development of a separate green market. In Holland a voluntary green certificate market has existed since the beginning of 1998. In Denmark a comprehensive restructuring of the legislation for the electric power industry has just been completed, including the framework for developing a separate green market for renewable electricity production. The main objectives of introducing this type of electricity market in Denmark is to secure the development of renewable energy technologies (including contributions to greenhouse gas reductions), while at the same time releasing the Government from the (by now) quite heavy burden of subsidising renewable technologies. Finally, a green market will make it possible for these renewable technologies to be partly economically compensated for the environmental benefits, which they generate compared to conventional power production. With the recent Danish legislation as starting point this paper analyzes possible ways to set up a green certificate market, treating as well some of the consequences produced when the market is actually funtioning. The analysis is applicable for all renewable technologies, but special attention is given to wind power.},

abstract = {Accumulation of compatible solutes, by uptake or de novo synthesis, enables bacteria to reduce the difference between osmotic potentials of the cell cytoplasm and the extracellular environment. To examine this process in the halophilic and halotolerant methanogenic archaebacteria, 14 strains were tested for the accumulation of compatible solutes in response to growth in various extracellular concentrations of NaCl. In external NaCl concentrations of 0.7 to 3.4 M, the halophilic methanogens accumulated K+ ion and low-molecular-weight organic compounds. beta-Glutamate was detected in two halotolerant strains that grew below 1.5 M NaCl. Two unusual beta-amino acids, N epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine and beta-glutamine (3-aminoglutaramic acid), as well as L-alpha-glutamate were compatible solutes among all of these strains. De novo synthesis of glycine betaine was also detected in several strains of moderately and extremely halophilic methanogens. The zwitterionic compounds (beta-glutamine, N epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine, and glycine betaine) and potassium were the predominant compatible solutes among the moderately and extremely halophilic methanogens. This is the first report of beta-glutamine as a compatible solute and de novo biosynthesis of glycine betaine in the methanogenic archaebacteria.},

abstract = {Biogenic formation of methane from coal is of great interest as an underexploited source of clean energy. The goal of some coal bed producers is to extend coal bed methane productivity and to utilize hydrocarbon wastes such as coal slurry to generate new methane. However, the process and factors controlling the process, and thus ways to stimulate it, are poorly understood. Subbituminous coal from a nonproductive well in south Texas was stimulated to produce methane in microcosms when the native population was supplemented with nutrients (biostimulation) or when nutrients and a consortium of bacteria and methanogens enriched from wetland sediment were added (bioaugmentation). The native population enriched by nutrient addition included Pseudomonas spp., Veillonellaceae, and Methanosarcina barkeri. The bioaugmented microcosm generated methane more rapidly and to a higher concentration than the biostimulated microcosm. Dissolved organics, including long-chain fatty acids, single-ring aromatics, and long-chain alkanes accumulated in the first 39 days of the bioaugmented microcosm and were then degraded, accompanied by generation of methane. The bioaugmented microcosm was dominated by Geobacter sp., and most of the methane generation was associated with growth of Methanosaeta concilii. The ability of the bioaugmentation culture to produce methane from coal intermediates was confirmed in incubations of culture with representative organic compounds. This study indicates that methane production could be stimulated at the nonproductive field site and that low microbial biomass may be limiting in situ methane generation. In addition, the microcosm study suggests that the pathway for generating methane from coal involves complex microbial partnerships.},

abstract = {A strictly anaerobic, irregularly coccoid, methanogenic archaeon, strain MG62T (= JCM 10825T = DSM 13459T), was isolated from paddy field soil in Chikugo, Fukuoka, Japan. The cells stained gram-negative, were 1.0-2.0 microm in diameter, were lysed by SDS and hypotonic solutions and were flagellated. Motility was not observed. The strain was able to use H2/CO2, 2-propanol/CO2, formate, 2-butanol/CO2 and cyclopentanol/CO2 as substrates for methanogenesis, but did not utilize acetate, ethanol, methanol or methylamines. The optimum temperature and pH were 25-30 degrees C and 6.7-7.2. Analysis of lipid component parts (core lipids, phospholipid polar head groups and glycolipid sugar moieties) showed the characteristic pattern of members of the family Methanomicrobiaceae except for the absence of glucose as a glycolipid sugar moiety. The G+C content of the DNA was 62.2 mol {\%}. Sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA revealed that the strain belonged to the genus Methanoculleus. The strain had DNA-DNA hybridization values of less than 50{\%} with type strains of Methanoculleus species. On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, the name Methanoculleus chikugoensis sp. nov. is proposed for strain MG62T (= JCM 10825T = DSM 13459T). The DNA hybridization study also revealed the close relationships of three species, Methanoculleus olentangyi, Methanoculleus bourgensis and Methanoculleus oldenburgensis, among Methanoculleus species.},

We employed a multidisciplinary approach that combined culture-dependent and -independent analyses with geochemical measurements in the sediments of Skan Bay, Alaska (53 degrees N, 167 degrees W), to investigate methanogenesis there. Cultivation-independent analyses of the archaeal community revealed that uncultivated microbes of the kingdoms Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota are present at Skan Bay and that methanogens constituted a small proportion of the archaeal community. Methanogens were cultivated from depths of 0 to 60 cm in the sediments, and several strains related to the orders Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales were isolated. Isolates were psychrotolerant marine-adapted strains and included an aceticlastic methanogen, strain AK-6, as well as three strains of CO(2)-reducing methanogens: AK-3, AK7, and AK-8. The phylogenetic positions and physiological characteristics of these strains are described. We propose a new species, Methanogenium boonei, with strain AK-7 as the type strain.},

abstract = {Improving anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge through pretreatment techniques is a suitable solution for better sludge management. In this sense, modeling may present itself as an important tool to assess and predict process performance and pretreatment effects. In this study, the feasibility of using biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests data for calibrating the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) was evaluated, in order to simulate the operation of continuous digesters fed, at different HRTs, with raw and autohydrolysis-pretreated waste activated sludge. This was achieved using a simplified COD fractioning methodology proposed to define ADM1 inputs. Hydrolysis constant rates were determined as the most sensitive parameters, and estimated using BMP tests. The calibrated model was then cross-validated with continuous digesters data sets. Good model performance was attained employing these techniques. The ADM1 was able to successfully represent the consumption of slowly biodegradable organic matter in BMP tests, the changes in hydrolytic limiting steps due to the autohydrolysis pretreatment and the behavior of the continuous digesters in overall. The COD fractioning methodology and the Xc variable manipulation proposed seemed to be crucial for proper model predictions. Results indicate that BMP tests are a suitable data source for ADM1 calibration, and that the model can be a powerful tool to assess the effect of the autohydrolysis pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of sewage waste activated sludge.},

abstract = {Agro-residues account for a large proportion of the wastes generated around the world. There is thus a need for a model to simulate the anaerobic digestion processes used in their treatment. We have developed model based on ADM1, to be applied to agro-wastes. We examined and tested the biodegradability of apple, pear, orange, rape, sunflower, pig manure and glycerol wastes to be used as the basis for feeding the model. Moreover, the fractions of particulate COD (X(c)) were calculated, and the disintegration constant was obtained from biodegradability profiles, considering disintegration to be the limiting process. The other kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were taken from the ADM1 model. The model operating under mono-substrate and co-substrate conditions was then validated with batch tests. At the same time the model was validated on a continuous anaerobic reactor operating with pig manure at lab scale. In both cases the correlation between the model and the experimental results was satisfactory. We conclude that the anaerobic digestion model is a reliable tool for the design and operation of plants in which agro-wastes are treated.},

abstract = {In this study, a procedure accounting for degradation kinetics was developed to split the total COD of a substrate into each input state variable required for Anaerobic Digestion Model n°1. The procedure is based on the combination of batch experimental degradation tests ("anaerobic respirometry") and numerical interpretation of the results obtained (optimisation of the ADM1 input state variable set). The effects of the main operating parameters, such as the substrate to inoculum ratio in batch experiments and the origin of the inoculum, were investigated. Combined with biochemical fractionation of the total COD of substrates, this method enabled determination of an ADM1-consistent input state variable set for each substrate with affordable identifiability. The substrate to inoculum ratio in the batch experiments and the origin of the inoculum influenced input state variables. However, based on results modelled for a CSTR fed with the substrate concerned, these effects were not significant. Indeed, if the optimal ranges of these operational parameters are respected, uncertainty in COD fractionation is mainly limited to temporal variability of the properties of the substrates. As the method is based on kinetics and is easy to implement for a wide range of substrates, it is a very promising way to numerically predict the effect of design parameters on the efficiency of an anaerobic CSTR. This method thus promotes the use of modelling for the design and optimisation of anaerobic processes.},

abstract = {Biomass samples taken during the continuous operation of thermophilic anaerobic digestors fed with manure and exposed to successive inhibitory pulses of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) were characterized in terms of specific metabolic activities and 16S rDNA DGGE profiling of the microbial community structure. Improvement of hydrogenotrophic and acidogenic ([beta]-oxidation) activity rates was detected upon successive LCFA pulses, while different inhibition effects over specific anaerobic trophic groups were observed. Bioreactor recovery capacity and biomass adaptation to LCFA inhibition were verified. Population profiles of eubacterial and archaeal 16S rDNA genes revealed that no significant shift on microbial community composition took place upon biomass exposure to LCFA. DNA sequencing of predominant DGGE bands showed close phylogenetic affinity to ribotypes characteristic from specific [beta]-oxidation bacterial genera (Syntrophomonas and Clostridium), while a single predominant syntrophic archaeae was related with the genus Methanosarcina. The hypothesis that biomass adaptation was fundamentally of physiological nature was tested using mathematical modelling, taking the IWA ADM1 as general model. New kinetics considering the relation between LCFA inhibitory substrate concentration and specific biomass content, as an approximation to the adsorption process, improved the model fitting and provided a better insight on the physical nature of the LCFA inhibition process.},

A simulation study based on the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) was done in order to show its applicability to lignocellulosic biomass. Therefore, the influent was fractioned by established fodder analysis (Weender analysis and van Soest method). ADM1 was modified with a separate compound of inert decay products similar to the approach of Activated Sludge Model No. 1 (ASM1). Furthermore, a function, which described the influence of solids on the process of hydrolysis, has been integrated to reproduce reliable ammonium concentrations. The model was calibrated by using the modified Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient to evaluate simulation quality. It was possible to fit observed data by changing only hydrogen inhibition constants and the maximum acetate uptake rate. The extended ADM1 model showed good agreement with measurements and was suitable for modeling anaerobic digestion of grass silage.},

The first-order hydrolysis rate constant of the process was estimated to be 0.6 d(-1). Despite the relative high ammonium concentration of up to 4 g/l, the system worked stable for an operation period of 310 days.

abstract = {Anaerobic digestion disintegration and hydrolysis have been traditionally modeled according to first-order kinetics assuming that their rates do not depend on disintegration/hydrolytic biomass concentrations. However, the typical sigmoid-shape increase in time of the disintegration/hydrolysis rates cannot be described with first-order models. For complex substrates, first-order kinetics should thus be modified to account for slowly degradable material. In this study, a slightly modified IWA ADM1 model is presented to simulate thermophilic anaerobic digestion of thermally pretreated waste activated sludge. Contois model is first included for disintegration and hydrolysis steps instead of first-order kinetics and Hill function is then used to model ammonia inhibition of aceticlastic methanogens instead of a non-competitive function. One batch experimental data set of anaerobic degradation of a raw waste activated sludge is used to calibrate the proposed model and three additional data sets from similar sludge thermally pretreated at three different temperatures are used to validate the parameters values.},

For further process optimization of anaerobic digestion, biogas production with the commonly used substrates, grass, maize, and green weed silage, together with industrial glycerine, were analyzed by the Weender analysis/van Soest method, and a simulation study was performed, based on the International Water Association's (IWA) Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1). The simplex algorithm was applied to optimize kinetic constants for disintegration and hydrolysis steps for all examined substrates. Consequently, new parameters were determined for each evaluated substrate, tested against experimental cumulative biogas production results, and assessed against ADM1 default values for disintegration and hydrolysis kinetic constants, where the ADM1 values for mesophilic high rate and ADM1 values for solids were used. Results of the optimization lead to a precise prediction of the kinetics of anaerobic degradation of complex substrates.},

abstract = {The anaerobic digestion process comprises a whole network of sequential and parallel reactions, of both biochemical and physicochemical nature. Mathematical models, aiming at understanding and optimization of the anaerobic digestion process, describe these reactions in a structured way, the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) being the most well established example. While these models distinguish between different microorganisms involved in different reactions, to our knowledge they all neglect species diversity between organisms with the same function, i.e. performing the same reaction. Nevertheless, available experimental evidence suggests that the structure and properties of a microbial community may be influenced by process operation and on their turn also determine the reactor functioning. In order to adequately describe these phenomena, mathematical models need to consider the underlying microbial diversity. This is demonstrated in this contribution by extending the ADM1 to describe microbial diversity between organisms of the same functional group. The resulting model has been compared with the traditional ADM1 in describing experimental data of a pilot-scale hybrid Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Filter Bed (UASFB) reactor, as well as in a more detailed simulation study. The presented model is further shown useful in assessing the relationship between reactor performance and microbial community structure in mesophilic CSTRs seeded with slaughterhouse wastewater when facing increasing levels of ammonia.},

abstract = {Autogenerative high pressure digestion (AHPD) is a novel configuration of anaerobic digestion, in which micro-organisms produce autogenerated biogas pressures up to 90 bar with {\textgreater}90{\%} CH(4)-content in a single step reactor. (1) The less than 10{\%} CO(2)-content was postulated to be resulting from proportionally more CO(2) dissolution relative to CH(4) at increasing pressure. However, at 90 bar of total pressure Henry's law also predicts dissolution of 81{\%} of produced CH(4). Therefore, in the present research we studied whether CO(2) can be selectively retained in solution at moderately high pressures up to 20 bar, aiming to produce high-calorific biogas with {\textgreater}90{\%} methane. Experiments were performed in an 8 L closed fed-batch pressure digester fed with acetate as the substrate. Experimental results confirmed CH(4) distribution over gas and liquid phase according to Henry's law, but the CO(2)-content of the biogas was only 1-2{\%}, at pH 7, that is, much lower than expected. By varying the ratio between acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and total inorganic carbon (TIC(produced)) of the substrate between 0 and 1, the biogas CO(2)-content could be controlled independently of pressure. However, by decreasing the ANC relative to the TIC(produced) CO(2) accumulation in the aqueous medium caused acidification to pH 5, but remarkably, acetic acid was still converted into CH(4) at a rate comparable to neutral conditions.},

This review focuses on operational considerations that require further research to allow implementation of AnMBR DWW treatment. Specific topics include membrane fouling, the lower limits of hydraulic retention time and temperature allowing for adequate treatment, complications with methane recovery, and nutrient removal options. Based on the current literature, future research efforts should focus on increasing the likelihood of net energy recovery through advancements in fouling control and development of efficient methods for dissolved methane recovery.

Recent calculations suggest that atmospheric CH4 emissions have been responsible for approximately 20{\%} of Earth's warming since pre-industrial times. Understanding how CH4 emissions from ecosystems will respond to expected increases in global temperature is therefore fundamental to predicting whether the carbon cycle will mitigate or accelerate climate change. Methanogenesis is the terminal step in the remineralization of organic matter and is carried out by strictly anaerobic Archaea. Like most other forms of metabolism, methanogenesis is temperature-dependent. However, it is not yet known how this physiological response combines with other biotic processes (for example, methanotrophy, substrate supply, microbial community composition) and abiotic processes (for example, water-table depth) to determine the temperature dependence of ecosystem-level CH4 emissions. It is also not known whether CH4 emissions at the ecosystem level have a fundamentally different temperature dependence than other key fluxes in the carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and respiration. Here we use meta-analyses to show that seasonal variations in CH4 emissions from a wide range of ecosystems exhibit an average temperature dependence similar to that of CH4 production derived from pure cultures of methanogens and anaerobic microbial communities. This average temperature dependence (0.96 electron volts (eV)), which corresponds to a 57-fold increase between 0 and 30°C, is considerably higher than previously observed for respiration (approximately 0.65 eV) and photosynthesis (approximately 0.3 eV). As a result, we show that both the emission of CH4 and the ratio of CH4 to CO2 emissions increase markedly with seasonal increases in temperature. Our findings suggest that global warming may have a large impact on the relative contributions of CO2 and CH4 to total greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic ecosystems, terrestrial wetlands and rice paddies.},

@article{Musto2006,
abstract = {Two years ago, we showed that positive correlations between optimal growth temperature (T(opt)) and genome GC are observed in 15 out of the 20 families of prokaryotes we analyzed, thus indicating that "T(opt) is one of the factors that influence genomic GC in prokaryotes". Our results were disputed, but these criticisms were demonstrated to be mistaken and based on misconceptions. In a recent report, Wang et al. [H.C. Wang, E. Susko, A.J. Roger, On the correlation between genomic G+C content and optimal growth temperature in prokaryotes: data quality and confounding factors, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 342 (2006) 681-684] criticize our results by stating that "all previous simple correlation analyses of GC versus temperature have ignored the fact that genomic GC content is influenced by multiple factors including both intrinsic mutational bias and extrinsic environmental factors". This statement, besides being erroneous, is surprising because it applies in fact not to ours but to the authors' article. Here, we rebut the points raised by Wang et al. and review some issues that have been a matter of debate, regarding the influence of environmental factors upon GC content in prokaryotes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the relationship that exists between genome size and GC level is valid for aerobic, facultative, and microaerophilic species, but not for anaerobic prokaryotes.},

abstract = {Summary Two new rod-shaped Gram-positive, autotrophic, thermophilic methanogens, strains ADZ and IDZ, were isolated from the anaerobic digestor sludge operating on waste waters containing methacrylates. The isolates use H2 + CO2 and formate as substrates for growth and methane production. Strain ADZ grows with a doubling time of 1.5 h under optimal conditions (60°C, pH 7.0, 25 mg/l Na2S, 0.8–20 g/l NaCl). The GC content of the DNA is 62.2 mol{\%}. Strain IDZ grows with a doubling time of 3.5 h under optimal conditions (55°C, pH 7.9–8.2, 150 mg/l Na2S, 1–30 g/l NaCl). The GC content of the DNA for the strain IDZ is 55 mol{\%}. The new isolates are closely related to the genus Methanobacterium, but differ from each other and from the members of the genus mentioned antigenically, in amino acid composition of cell walls, low DNA-DNA homology and the GC content of the DNA. Therefore, they are considered as a new species of the genus Methanobacterium, which we name Methanobacterium thermoflexum with type strain IDZ (VKM B-1963), and Methanobacterium defluvii with type strain ADZ (VKM B-1962).},

abstract = {A thermophilic strain of Methanosarcina, designated Methanosarcina strain TM-1, was isolated from a laboratory-scale 55 degrees C anaerobic sludge digestor by the Hungate roll-tube technique. Penicillin and d-cycloserine, inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis, were used as selective agents to eliminate contaminating non-methanogens. Methanosarcina strain TM-1 had a temperature optimum for methanogenesis near 50 degrees C and grew at 55 degrees C but not at 60 degrees C. Substrates used for methanogenesis and growth by Methanosarcina strain TM-1 were acetate (12-h doubling time), methanol (7- to 10-h doubling time), methanol-acetate mixtures (5-h doubling time), methylamine, and trimethylamine. When radioactively labeled acetate was the sole methanogenic substrate added to the growth medium, it was predominantly split to methane and carbon dioxide. When methanol was also present in the medium, the metabolism of acetate shifted to its oxidation and incorporation into cell material. Electrons derived from acetate oxidation apparently were used to reduce methanol. H(2)-CO(2) was not used for growth and methanogenesis by Methanosarcina strain TM-1. When presented with both H(2)-CO(2) and methanol, Methanosarcina strain TM-1 was capable of limited hydrogen metabolism during growth on methanol, but hydrogen metabolism ceased once the methanol was depleted. Methanosarcina strain TM-1 required a growth factor (or growth factors) present in the supernatant of anaerobic digestor sludge. Growth factor requirements and the inability to use H(2)-CO(2) are characteristics not found in other described Methanosarcina strains. The high numbers of Methanosarcina-like clumps in sludges from thermophilic digestors and the fast generation times reported here for Methanosarcina TM-1 indicate that Methanosarcina may play an important role in thermophilic methanogenesis.},

AG86 required NaCl and Mg2+ and trace amounts of selenite and tungstate. Vitamins were not required. However, yeast extract, Casamino acids and Trypticase stimulated growth significantly. When grown in the presence of these stimulants and at the optimal growth temperature and pH 6.5, the minimum doubling time was 20 min. Cells were fragile and readily lysed by detergents. The mol{\%} G+C was 33{\%}. These results and partial 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that AG86 belonged to the genus Methanococcus and closely resembled Methanococcus jannaschii. Tests for extrachromosomal DNA revealed a plasmid in AG86 and two plasmids in M. jannaschii. Different patterns were obtained from restriction endonuclease digestion of the three plasmids, and no homology was observed with DNA-DNA hybridization.},

We characterize the metabolic network and compare it to reconstructions from the prokaryotic, eukaryotic and archaeal domains. Using the model in conjunction with constraint-based methods, we simulate the metabolic fluxes and resulting phenotypes induced by different environmental and genetic conditions. This represents the first large-scale simulation of either a methanogen or an archaeal species. Model predictions are validated by comparison to experimental growth measurements and phenotypes of M. barkeri on different substrates. The predicted growth phenotypes for wild type and mutants of the methanogenic pathway have a high level of agreement with experimental findings. We further examine the efficiency of the energy-conserving reactions in the methanogenic pathway, specifically the Ech hydrogenase reaction, and determine a stoichiometry for the nitrogenase reaction. This work demonstrates that a reconstructed metabolic network can serve as an analysis platform to predict cellular phenotypes, characterize methanogenic growth, improve the genome annotation and further uncover the metabolic characteristics of methanogenesis.},

Thus, the nomenclature of a group of organisms depends on the way they are classified, and the classification (among other elements) depends on the information gathered as a result of characterization. While nomenclature is governed by the Bacteriological Code, the classification and characterization of prokaryotes is an area that is not formally regulated and one in which numerous changes have taken place in the last 50 years. The purpose of the present article is to outline the key elements in the way that prokaryotes are characterized, with a view to providing an overview of some of the pitfalls commonly encountered in taxonomic papers.},

The representatives of the collections participating in MINE have agreed to adopt a general format for the computer storage and retrieval of strain data. This uniform format will facilitate the electronic combination and exchange of data from different collections in order to produce integrated catalogues and the use of identical commands to search the different databases. It is recommended to other collections who may wish to contribute data to the MINE network or between themselves. Three kinds of records can be linked to the leading 'species records': strain records, synonym records, and alternative morphonym records. A minimum data set of 30 fields (similar to the fields used for producing catalogues) is defined that facilitates the exchange of data between the national nodes and serves as a directory to strains available at other nodes. It is suggested that the full strain record comprise 99 fields, grouped in 12 blocks: internal administration--name--strain administration--status--environment and history--biological interactions--sexuality--properties (cytology, biomolecular data)--genotype and genetics--growth conditions--chemistry and enzymes--practical applications. Several fields are divided into subfields of different ranks. Delimiters are used either to separate a range of entries that have to be indexed or to divide an entry from the reference to its source or remarks that should not be indexed. The contents and structure of the fields proposed for filamentous fungi and yeasts are described and in some cases illustrated by examples. Uniformity of input is essential for indexed fields and desirable for non-indexed fields. Seven thesaurus files are envisaged to ensure consistency.},

The MRT of the particulate and liquid phases in the intestines was obtained after faecal particles labelled by Europium and Chromium EDTA were pulse dosed through the duodenal cannula. Following test meals, total faecal collection and spot sampling of duodenal digesta were performed at fixed intervals. TMRT were 51.7, 45.6, 40.6 h and SMRT were 39.5, 31.9 and 28.0 h, respectively, for hay, ground hay and concentrate. The MRT of the liquids in the rumen (8.7 h) was shorter than the SMRT of particles but there was no differential passage between liquids and particles after the duodenum. Intestinal MRT averaged 11 h and was partitioned into 7.5 and 3.5, respectively, for MRT in the tubular sections and the caecum-proximal colon. The compartmental analysis of the faecal patterns of markers given during a test meal gives the following results. The time associated with the descending part of faecal kinetics (respectively, 25.3 and 22.9 h for hay and concentrate) is directly related to the escape of feed particles from the rumen. The delay of first appearance of markers mostly reflects transit in the post duodenal tubular sections for the concentrate. The time associated with the ascending part (respectively, 16.9 and 9.4 h for hay and concentrate) represents the time required to reduce the size of the forage particles (7 h according to the difference between TMRT of long and ground hay direct measurements) and caecal mixing (3.5 h) as well as other compartments or processes that are not clearly identified.},

abstract = {Methanosarcina strain 227 exhibited exponential growth on sodium acetate in the absence of added H2. Under these conditions, rates of methanogenesis were limited by concentrations of acetate below 0.05 M. One mole of methane was formed per mole of acetate consumed. Additional evidence from radioactive labeling studies indicated that sufficient energy for growth was obtained by the decarboxylation of acetate. Diauxic growth and sequential methanogenesis from methanol followed by acetate occurred in the presence of mixtures of methanol and acetate. Detailed studies showed that methanol-grown cells did not metabolize acetate in the presence of methanol, although acetate-grown cells did metabolize methanol and acetate simultaneously before shifting to methanol. Acetate catabolism appeared to be regulated in response to the presence of better metabolizable substrates such as methanol or H2-CO2 by a mechanism resembling catabolite repression. Inhibition of methanogenesis from acetate by 2-bromoethanesulfonate, an analog of coenzyme M, was reversed by addition of coenzyme M. Labeling studies also showed that methanol may lie on the acetate pathway. These results suggested that methanogenesis from acetate, methanol, and H2-CO2 may have some steps in common, as originally proposed by Barker. Studies with various inhibitors, together with molar growth yield data, suggest a role for electron transport mechanisms in energy metabolism during methanogenesis from methanol, acetate, and H2-CO2. },

abstract = {Acetate is the precursor of approximately two-thirds of the methane produced in anaerobic bioreactors. Only two genera of methanogenic archae are known to use acetate as sole energy source: Methanosarcina and Methanothrix. Methanosarcina appears to be a generalist with a high growth rate, but low affinity for acetate. Methanothrix is a specialist having a high affinity for acetate, but low growth rate. Methanothrix shows a much lower minimum threshold for acetate utilization (7–70 $\mu$M) than Methanosarcina (0.2–1.2 mM). This is consistent with the evidence that Methanothrix is found in environments with low acetate concentrations. The acetate degradation by acetotrophic methanogens starts with an activation of acetate to acetyl-coenzyme A. In Methanosarcina spp. this activation is catalysed by an acetate kinase/phosphotransacetylase system at the expense of one ATP. Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase activates acetate in Methanothrix, with concomitant hydrolysis of one ATP to AMP and PPi. Both enzyme systems have been purified and comparison of the kinetic properties confirmed the hypothesis that low acetate concentrations favour Methanothrix. The gene encoding for acetyl-CoA synthetase of Methanothrix was isolated from a genomic library and actively expressed in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence showed homology to proteins with similar function and contained two putative ATP binding sites. The most characteristic and complex enzyme involved in the acetate degradation by acetotrophic methanogens is carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. The enzyme has been purified from both Methanothrix and Methanosarcina, and represents 5–10{\%} of the soluble protein of these microorganisms. CO dehydrogenase is proposed to catalyse both the cleavage of acetyl-CoA in a methyl-, carbonyl- and CoA-moiety, and the oxidation of the carbonyl group to CO2. This multifunctional redox enzyme contains several iron, acid-labile sulfur and nickel atoms. These atoms are arranged into several paramagnetic complexes, which have been studied by EPR spectroscopy. The low spin recovery of the different paramagnetic centers makes statements about structure and functions difficult. There are good spectroscopic and genetic indications that the CO dehydrogenase of Methanothrix contains at least one ferrodoxin-like [4Fe-4S] cluster, which could play a role in the electron transfer of the CO oxidation. Further, in EPR spectra of concentrated samples of CO dehydrogenase from Methanothrix a very unusual signal was observed, which showed great similarity to putative [6Fe-6S] prismane clusters. The final step in the methanogenesis from acetate, the reduction of methyl-coenzyme M, is catalysed by methyl-coenzyme M methylreductase. The enzyme purified from Methanothrix and Methanosarcina showed great homology with the methyl-CoM methylreductase of other methanogenic archae, although the specific activity was rather low (60–125 nmol min−1 mg−1). The reduction of the heterodisulfide between coenzyme M and component B is proposed to be the common site for energy conservation in all methanogens. Acetoclastic methanogens, however, need additional sites of energy conservation to compensate for their high energy input in acetate activation. The oxidation of CO to CO2 could form one possible site. The partially membrane-associated pyrophosphatase of Methanothrix could form another site of energy conservation.},

abstract = {A predominant methanogenic bacterium was isolated from salt-marsh sediment near Pawley's Island, South Carolina. A habitat-simulating medium with H2:CO2 as substrate was used for enrichment and isolation. The methanogen is strictly anaerobic, weakly-motile, non-sporeforming, Gram negative, and a pleomorphic coccoid-rod averaging 1.2 by 1.6 $\mu$m. Colonies are circular, translucent, pale yellow, and have a smooth surface and an entire edge. The organism is a mesophile, growing between 18 and 47°C, with an optimum near 38°C. The pH optimum for growth is 6.8–7.2, and only formate or a mixture of H2 plus CO2 serve as substrates. Seawater (20–70{\%} v/v) is required, but it can be replaced by 15 mM, or greater, magnesium. Optimal growth occurs with 110 mM sodium. Growth rate is stimulated by selenium (10 $\mu$M) but organic compounds (acetate, vitamins, amino acids) are neither stimulatory nor required. The methanogen grows well in autotrophic medium with a doubling time of about 2h. Cells are fragile, are lysed by aqueous solutions of low osmolality and by detergents, and the lack muramic acid. The cell wall is a single electron dense layer. The DNA base composition is 33 mol {\%} guanine plus cytosine. Antigenic relationship of cells and the 16S ribosomal RNA catalog indicate that the salt marsh methanogen is a unique species of Methanococcus, for which we propose the name Methanococcus maripaludis sp. nov.},

abstract = {We have developed a technique for cultivation of chemolithoautotrophs under high hydrostatic pressures that is successfully applicable to various types of deep-sea chemolithoautotrophs, including methanogens. It is based on a glass-syringe-sealing liquid medium and gas mixture used in conjunction with a butyl rubber piston and a metallic needle stuck into butyl rubber. By using this technique, growth, survival, and methane production of a newly isolated, hyperthermophilic methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri strain 116 are characterized under high temperatures and hydrostatic pressures. Elevated hydrostatic pressures extend the temperature maximum for possible cell proliferation from 116°C at 0.4 MPa to 122°C at 20 MPa, providing the potential for growth even at 122°C under an in situ high pressure. In addition, piezophilic growth significantly affected stable carbon isotope fractionation of methanogenesis from CO2. Under conventional growth conditions, the isotope fractionation of methanogenesis by M. kandleri strain 116 was similar to values (−34‰ to−27‰) previously reported for other hydrogenotrophic methanogens. However, under high hydrostatic pressures, the isotope fractionation effect became much smaller ({\textless}−12‰), and the kinetic isotope effect at 122°C and 40 MPa was −9.4‰, which is one of the smallest effects ever reported. This observation will shed light on the sources and production mechanisms of deep-sea methane.},

The coccoid-shaped cells are flagellated and exhibit a sligh tumbling motility. The temperature range for growth at pH 6.5 was 49--89 °C, with optimum growth at 80 °C. The optimum pH for growth was 6.5, and the optimum NaCI concentration for growth was around 25 g I-1. The new isolat used H2 and CO2 as the only substrates for growth and methane production. Tungsten, selenium and yeast extract stimulated growth significantly. In the presence of C02 and H2 the organism reduced elemental sulphur to hydrogen sulphide. Growth was inhibited by chloramphenicol and rifampicin, but not by ampicillin, kanamycin, penicillin and streptomycin. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 31 mol{\%}. As determined by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, this organism was closely related to Methanococcus jannaschii strain JAL-1T. However, despite the high percentage of similarity between their 16S rDNA sequences (97.1 {\%}), the DNA-DNA hybridization levels between these strains were less than 5{\%}. On the basis of these observations and physiological traits, it is proposed that this organism should be placed in a new species, Methanococcus vulcanius. The type strain is M7T(= DSM 12094T) During the course of this study, the 16S rDNA sequence analysis placed Methanococcus sp. strain AG86T(= DSM 4213T) as a close relative of M. jannaschii strain JAL-1T. However, the weak level of DNA-DNA hybridization with this strain ({\textless} 10{\%}) allowed the proposal that strain AG86Talso constitutes a new species, Methanococcus fervens.},

abstract = {A psychrotolerant hydrogenotrophic methanogen, strain Pt1, was isolated from a syntrophic propionate-oxidizing methanogenic consortium obtained from granulated biomass of a two-stage low-temperature (3–8 °C) anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) bioreactor, fed with a mixture of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (acetate, propionate and butyrate). The strain was strictly anaerobic, and cells were curved rods, 0.4–0.5×7.5–25 µm, that sometimes formed wavy filaments from 25 to several hundred micrometres in length. Cells stained Gram-negative and were non-sporulating. They were gently motile by means of tufted flagella. The strain grew at 5–37 °C (optimum at 20–30 °C), at pH 6.0–10 (optimum 7.0–7.5) and with 0–0.3 M NaCl (optimum 0 M NaCl). Growth and methane production was found with H2/CO2 and very weak growth with formate. Acetate and yeast extract stimulated growth, but were not essential. The G+C content of the DNA of strain Pt1 was 40 mol{\%}. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain Pt1 was a member of the genus Methanospirillum and showed 97.5 {\%} sequence similarity to Methanospirillum hungatei JF1T and 94 {\%} sequence similarity to Methanospirillum lacunae Ki8-1T. DNA–DNA hybridization of strain Pt1 with Methanospirillum hungatei JF1T revealed 39 {\%} relatedness. On the basis of its phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic position, strain Pt1 is a representative of a novel species of the genus Methanospirillum, for which the name Methanospirillum stamsii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Pt1T ( = DSM 26304T = VKM B-2808T).},

abstract = {A methanogen, strain AK-1, was isolated from permanently cold marine sediments, 38- to 45-cm below the sediment surface at Skan Bay, Alaska. The cells were highly irregular, nonmotile coccoids (diameter, 1 to 1.2 microm), occurring singly. Cells grew by reducing CO2 with H2 or formate as electron donor. Growth on formate was much slower than that on H2. Acetate, methanol, ethanol, 1- or 2-propanol, 1- or 2-butanol and trimethylamine were not catabolized. The cells required acetate, thiamine, riboflavin, a high concentration of vitamin B12, and peptones for growth; yeast extract stimulated growth but was not required. The cells grew fastest at 25 degrees C (range 5 degrees C to 25 degrees C), at a pH of 6.0-6.6 (growth range, pH 5.5-7.5), and at a salinity of 0.25-1.25 M Na+. Cells of this and other H2-using methanogens from saline environments metabolized H2 to a very low threshold pressure (less than 1 Pa) that was dependent on the methane partial pressure. We propose that the threshold pressure may be limited by the energetics of catabolism. The sequence of the 16S rDNA gene of strain AK-1 was most similar (98{\%}) to the sequences of Methanogenium cariaci JR-1 and Methanogeniumfrigidum Ace-2. DNA-DNA hybridization between strain AK-1 and these two strains showed only 34.9{\%} similarity to strain JR-1 and 56.5{\%} similarity to strain Ace-2. These analyses indicated strain AK-1 should be classified as a new species within the genus Methanogenium. Phenotypic differences between strain AK-1 and these strains (including growth temperature, salinity range, pH range, and nutrient requirements) support this. Therefore, a new species, Methanogenium marinum, is proposed with strain AK-1 as type strain.},

Strain 17A1T grew in a mineral medium and its growth was stimulated by the addition of yeast extract, vitamins, acetate or rumen fluid. Penicillin, vancomycin and kanamycin reduced growth but did not completely inhibit it. Growth occurred at 14–41 °C (optimum 30 °C), at pH 5.0–8.5 (optimum pH 6.5) and with 0–0.4 M NaCl (optimum 0.1 M).

abstract = {A small irregular coccoid methanogenic bacterium (PAT) was isolated from the hindgut of the cockroach Periplaneta americana. Fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy of the hindgut of P. americana suggest that the organism occurs abundantly in the microbiota attached to the hindgut wall. The strain produces methane by the reduction of methanol and methylated amines with molecular hydrogen. Acetate, coenzyme M, yeast extract, tryptic soy broth and vitamins are required for growth. The cells lack a rigid cell wall and lyse immediately in buffers of low ionic strength. Maximum rate of growth (specific growth rate, 0.22 h(-1)) occurs in a rich medium at 39 degrees C, at a pH range of 7.2-7.7 and at a salt concentration below 100 mM NaCl. Sequence analysis of the small-subunit rDNA indicates that strain PAT is related to the family Methanosarcinaceae but does not belong to any previously described genus. Therefore, it is proposed that strain PAT be classified in a new genus, related to the Methanosarcinaceae, as Methanomicrococcus blatticola (type strain PAT = DSM 13328T).},

Strains AK-4 (=OCM 774), AK-5T (=OCM 775T=DSM 17273T) and AK-9 (=OCM 793) were isolated from the sulfate-reducing zone of the sediments. Each of the strains was a non-motile coccus and occurred singly. Cells grew with trimethylamine as a catabolic substrate and strain AK-4 could also catabolize methanol. Yeast extract and trypticase peptones were not required for growth, but their addition to the culture medium slightly stimulated growth. Each of the strains grew at temperatures of 5-28 degrees C; they were slight halophiles and grew fastest in the neutral pH range. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain AK-4 was most closely related to Methanosarcina baltica. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed 88 {\%} relatedness, suggesting that strain AK-4 represents a novel strain within this species. Strains AK-5T and AK-9 had identical 16S rRNA gene sequences that were most closely related to the sequence of Methanococcoides burtonii (99.8 {\%} sequence similarity). DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed that strains AK-5T and AK-9 are members of the same species (88 {\%} relatedness value), but strain AK-5T had a DNA-DNA relatedness value of only 55 {\%} to Methanococcoides burtonii.

Their morphology, gram-positive staining reaction, resistance to cell lysis by chemical agents, and narrow range of utilizable substrates were typical of species belonging to the family Methanobacteriaceae. Analysis of the nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rRNA-encoding genes confirmed this affiliation and supported their recognition as new species of Methanobrevibacter: M. cuticularis (RFM-1) and M. curvatus (RFM-2). The per cell rates of methanogenesis by strains RFM-1 and RFM-2 in vitro, taken together with their in situ population densities (ca. 106 cells z gut21; equivalent to 109 cells z ml of gut fluid21), could fully account for the rate of methane emission by the live termites. UV epifluorescence and electron microscopy confirmed that RFM-1- and RFM-2-type cells were the dominant methanogens in R. flavipes collected in Michigan (but were not the only methanogens associated with this species) and that they colonized the peripheral, microoxic region of the hindgut, i.e., residing on or near the hindgut epithelium and also attached to filamentous prokaryotes associated with the gut wall. An examination of their oxygen tolerance revealed that both strains possessed catalase-like activity. Moreover, when dispersed in tubes of agar medium under H2-CO2-O2 (75: 18.8:6.2, vol/vol/vol), both strains grew to form a thin plate about 6 mm below the meniscus, just beneath the oxic-anoxic interface. Such growth plates were capable of mediating a net consumption of O2 that otherwise penetrated much deeper into uninoculated control tubes. Similar results were obtained with an authentic strain of Methanobrevibacter arboriphilicus. This is the first detailed description of an important and often cited but poorly understood component of the termite gut microbiota.},

Acetone- and isopropanol-utilizing bacteria slowly ferment these substrates to acetate, which allows Methanosaeta spp. to maintain the acetate concentration at levels below the threshold required for growth of Methanosarcina spp. These enrichments eventually develop dense populations of Methanosaeta spp., which can then be separated from contaminating microorganisms to yield axenic cultures.},

Analysis of the DNA sequences from the conserved regions yielded two degenerate sequences from which a forward primer, a 32-mer, and a reverse primer, a 23-mer, could be derived for use in the specific PCR-based detection of methanogens. The primers were successfully evaluated against 23 species of methanogen representing all five recognized orders of this group of Archaea, generating a PCR product between 464 and 491 bp. Comparisons between the mcrA and 16S small subunit rRNA gene sequences using PHYLIP demonstrated that the tree topologies were strikingly similar. Methods were developed to enable the analysis of methanogen populations in landfill using the mcrA gene as the target. Two landfill sites were examined and 63 clones from a site in Mucking, Essex, and 102 from a site in Odcombe, Somerset, were analysed. Analysis revealed a far greater diversity in the methanogen population within landfill material than has been seen previously.},

The specified phenotypic characteristics are often not sufficient to distinguish among taxa or to determine the phylogenetic placement of a taxon, and, in these cases, additional chemotaxonomic, molecular, or genetic data may be required. The placement of a new taxon should be consistent with phylogeny, usually based on tests such as nucleic acid sequencing or cataloging studies or on protein fingerprinting.

For standard growth conditions in laboratory culture, the cytoplasmic localization of the enzyme in Methanothermobacter marburgensis, Methanothermobacter wolfei, Methanococcus maripaludis, Methanosarcina mazei, and in anaerobically methane-oxidizing biofilms is demonstrated. Under growth limiting conditions on nickel-depleted media, at low linear growth of cultures, a fraction of 50-70{\%} of the enzyme was localized close to the cytoplasmic membrane, which implies "facultative" membrane association of the enzyme. This feature may be also useful for assessment of growth-limiting conditions in microbial biofilms.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence from sequence data from various environments, including the human gut, suggests the existence of a previously unknown putative seventh order of methanogens. The first genomic data from members of this lineage, Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis and "Candidatus Methanomethylophilus alvus," provide insights into its evolutionary history and metabolic features. Phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal proteins robustly indicates a monophyletic group independent of any previously known methanogenic order, which shares ancestry with the Marine Benthic Group D, the Marine Group II, the DHVE2 group, and the Thermoplasmatales. This phylogenetic position, along with the analysis of enzymes involved in core methanogenesis, strengthens a single ancient origin of methanogenesis in the Euryarchaeota and indicates further multiple independent losses of this metabolism in nonmethanogenic lineages than previously suggested. Genomic analysis revealed an unprecedented loss of the genes coding for the first six steps of methanogenesis from H₂/CO₂ and the oxidative part of methylotrophic methanogenesis, consistent with the fact that M. luminyensis and "Ca. M. alvus" are obligate H₂-dependent methylotrophic methanogens. Genomic data also suggest that these methanogens may use a large panel of methylated compounds. Phylogenetic analysis including homologs retrieved from environmental samples indicates that methylotrophic methanogenesis (regardless of dependency on H₂) is not restricted to gut representatives but may be an ancestral characteristic of the whole order, and possibly also of ancient origin in the Euryarchaeota. 16S rRNA and McrA trees show that this new order of methanogens is very diverse and occupies environments highly relevant for methane production, therefore representing a key lineage to fully understand the diversity and evolution of methanogenesis.},

abstract = {Methanogens are of great importance in carbon cycling and alternative energy production, but quantitation with culture-based methods is time-consuming and biased against methanogen groups that are difficult to cultivate in a laboratory. For these reasons, methanogens are typically studied through culture-independent molecular techniques. We developed a SYBR green I quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to quantify total numbers of methyl coenzyme M reductase alpha-subunit (mcrA) genes. TaqMan probes were also designed to target nine different phylogenetic groups of methanogens in qPCR assays. Total mcrA and mcrA levels of different methanogen phylogenetic groups were determined from six samples: four samples from anaerobic digesters used to treat either primarily cow or pig manure and two aliquots from an acidic peat sample stored at 4 degrees C or 20 degrees C. Only members of the Methanosaetaceae, Methanosarcina, Methanobacteriaceae, and Methanocorpusculaceae and Fen cluster were detected in the environmental samples. The three samples obtained from cow manure digesters were dominated by members of the genus Methanosarcina, whereas the sample from the pig manure digester contained detectable levels of only members of the Methanobacteriaceae. The acidic peat samples were dominated by both Methanosarcina spp. and members of the Fen cluster. In two of the manure digester samples only one methanogen group was detected, but in both of the acidic peat samples and two of the manure digester samples, multiple methanogen groups were detected. The TaqMan qPCR assays were successfully able to determine the environmental abundance of different phylogenetic groups of methanogens, including several groups with few or no cultivated members.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence and diversity of human methanogens are insufficiently characterised in the gastrointestinal tract of both health and disease. A PCR and clone library methodology targeting the mcrA gene was adopted to facilitate the two-fold aim of surveying the relative incidence of methanogens in health and disease groups and also to provide an overview of methanogen diversity in the human gastrointestinal tract.

RESULTS: DNA faecal extracts (207 in total) from a group of healthy controls and five gastrointestinal disease groups were investigated. Colorectal cancer, polypectomised, irritable bowel syndrome and the control group had largely equivalent numbers of individuals positive for methanogens (range 45-50{\%}). Methanogen incidence in the inflammatory bowel disease groups was reduced, 24{\%} for ulcerative colitis and 30{\%} for Crohn's disease. Four unique mcrA gene restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles were identified and bioinformatic analyses revealed that the majority of all sequences (94{\%}) retrieved from libraries were 100{\%} identical to Methanobrevibacter smithii mcrA gene. In addition, mcrA gene sequences most closely related to Methanobrevibacter oralis and members of the order Methanosarcinales were also recovered.

CONCLUSION: The mcrA gene serves as a useful biomarker for methanogen detection in the human gut and the varying trends of methanogen incidence in the human gut could serve as important indicators of intestinal function. Although Methanobrevibacter smithii is the dominant methanogen in both the distal colon of individuals in health and disease, the diversity of methanogens is greater than previously reported. In conclusion, the low incidence of methanogens in Inflammatory Bowel Disease, the functionality of the methanogens and impact of methane production in addition to competitive interactions between methanogens and other microbial groups in the human gastrointestinal tract warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {We used a phylogenetic approach to analyze the evolution of methanogenesis and methanogens. We show that 23 vertically transmitted ribosomal proteins do not support the monophyly of methanogens, and propose instead that there are two distantly related groups of extant archaea that produce methane, which we have named Class I and Class II. Based on this finding, we subsequently investigated the uniqueness of the origin of methanogenesis by studying both the enzymes of methanogenesis and the proteins that synthesize its specific coenzymes. We conclude that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis appeared only once during evolution. Genes involved in the seven central steps of the methanogenic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) are ubiquitous in methanogens and share a common history. This suggests that, although extant methanogens produce methane from various substrates (CO(2), formate, acetate, methylated C-1 compounds), these archaea have a core of conserved enzymes that have undergone little evolutionary change. Furthermore, this core of methanogenesis enzymes seems to originate (as a whole) from the last ancestor of all methanogens and does not appear to have been horizontally transmitted to other organisms or between members of Class I and Class II. The observation of a unique and ancestral form of methanogenesis suggests that it was preserved in two independent lineages, with some instances of specialization or added metabolic flexibility. It was likely lost in the Halobacteriales, Thermoplasmatales and Archaeoglobales. Given that fossil evidence for methanogenesis dates back 2.8 billion years, a unique origin of this process makes the methanogenic archaea a very ancient taxon.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methanomicrobiales is the least studied order of methanogens. While these organisms appear to be more closely related to the Methanosarcinales in ribosomal-based phylogenetic analyses, they are metabolically more similar to Class I methanogens.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to improve our understanding of this lineage, we have completely sequenced the genomes of two members of this order, Methanocorpusculum labreanum Z and Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1, and compared them with the genome of a third, Methanospirillum hungatei JF-1. Similar to Class I methanogens, Methanomicrobiales use a partial reductive citric acid cycle for 2-oxoglutarate biosynthesis, and they have the Eha energy-converting hydrogenase. In common with Methanosarcinales, Methanomicrobiales possess the Ech hydrogenase and at least some of them may couple formylmethanofuran formation and heterodisulfide reduction to transmembrane ion gradients. Uniquely, M. labreanum and M. hungatei contain hydrogenases similar to the Pyrococcus furiosus Mbh hydrogenase, and all three Methanomicrobiales have anti-sigma factor and anti-anti-sigma factor regulatory proteins not found in other methanogens. Phylogenetic analysis based on seven core proteins of methanogenesis and cofactor biosynthesis places the Methanomicrobiales equidistant from Class I methanogens and Methanosarcinales.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that Methanomicrobiales, rather than being similar to Class I methanogens or Methanomicrobiales, share some features of both and have some unique properties. We find that there are three distinct classes of methanogens: the Class I methanogens, the Methanomicrobiales (Class II), and the Methanosarcinales (Class III).},

abstract = {Methanogens are a phylogenetically diverse group belonging to Euryarchaeota. Previously, phylogenetic approaches using large datasets revealed that methanogens can be grouped into two classes, "Class I" and "Class II". However, some deep relationships were not resolved. For instance, the monophyly of "Class I" methanogens, which consist of Methanopyrales, Methanobacteriales and Methanococcales, is disputable due to weak statistical support. In this study, we use MSOAR to identify common orthologous genes from eight methanogen species and a Thermococcale species (outgroup), and apply GRAPPA and FastME to compute distance-based gene order phylogeny. The gene order phylogeny supports two classes of methanogens, but it differs from the original classification of methanogens by placing Methanopyrales and Methanobacteriales together with Methanosarcinales in Class II rather than with Methanococcales. This study suggests a new classification scheme for methanogens. In addition, it indicates that gene order phylogeny can complement traditional sequence-based methods in addressing taxonomic questions for deep relationships.},

However, anaerobic digestion is a complex biological process, where hundreds of microbial populations are involved, and whose start-up and operation are delicate issues. In order to better understand the process dynamics and to optimize the operating conditions, the availability of dynamic models is of paramount importance. Such models have to be inferred from prior knowledge and experimental data collected from real plants. Modeling and parameter identification are vast subjects, offering a realm of approaches and methods, which can be difficult to fully understand by scientists and engineers dedicated to the plant operation and improvements. This review article discusses existing modeling frameworks and methodologies for parameter estimation and model validation in the field of anaerobic digestion processes.

Therefore, the influent was fractioned by established fodder analysis (Weender analysis and van Soest method). ADM1 was modified with a separate compound of inert decay products similar to the approach of Activated Sludge Model No. 1 (ASM1). Furthermore, a function, which described the influence of solids on the process of hydrolysis, has been integrated to reproduce reliable ammonium concentrations. The model was calibrated by using the modified Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient to evaluate simulation quality. It was possible to fit observed data by changing only hydrogen inhibition constants and the maximum acetate uptake rate. The extended ADM1 model showed good agreement with measurements and was suitable for modeling anaerobic digestion of grass silage.},

Methane was produced, at potentials more negative than -650 mV vs. SHE, both via abiotically produced hydrogen gas (i.e., via hydrogenophilic methanogenesis) and via direct extracellular electron transfer. The relative contribution of these two mechanisms was highly dependent on the set cathode potential. Both cyclic voltammetry tests and batch potentiostatic experiments indicated that the capacity for extracellular electron transfer was a constitutive trait of the hydrogenophilic methanogenic culture. In principle, both electrons and carbon dioxide required for methane production could be obtained from a bioanode carrying out the oxidation of waste organic substrates.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates enhanced methane production from wastewater in laboratory-scale anaerobic reactors equipped with electrodes for water electrolysis. The electrodes were installed in the reactor sludge bed and a voltage of 2.8-3.5 V was applied resulting in a continuous supply of oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen created micro-aerobic conditions, which facilitated hydrolysis of synthetic wastewater and reduced the release of hydrogen sulfide to the biogas. A portion of the hydrogen produced electrolytically escaped to the biogas improving its combustion properties, while another part was converted to methane by hydrogenotrophic methanogens, increasing the net methane production. The presence of oxygen in the biogas was minimized by limiting the applied voltage. At a volumetric energy consumption of 0.2-0.3 Wh/L(R), successful treatment of both low and high strength synthetic wastewaters was demonstrated. Methane production was increased by 10-25{\%} and reactor stability was improved in comparison to a conventional anaerobic reactor.},

abstract = {It has been demonstrated previously that Geobacter species can transfer electrons directly to electrodes. In order to determine whether electrodes could serve as electron donors for microbial respiration, enrichment cultures were established from a sediment inoculum with a potentiostat-poised graphite electrode as the sole electron donor and nitrate as the electron acceptor. Nitrate was reduced to nitrite with the consumption of electrical current. The stoichiometry of electron and nitrate consumption and nitrite accumulation were consistent with the electrode serving as the sole electron donor for nitrate reduction. Analysis of 16 rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that the electrodes supplied with current were specifically enriched in microorganisms with sequences most closely related to the sequences of known Geobacter species. A pure culture of Geobacter metallireducens was shown to reduce nitrate to nitrite with the electrode as the sole electron donor with the expected stoichiometry of electron consumption. Cells attached to the electrode appeared to be responsible for the nitrate reduction. Attached cells of Geobacter sulfurreducens reduced fumarate to succinate with the electrode as an electron donor. These results demonstrate for the first time that electrodes may serve as a direct electron donor for anaerobic respiration. This finding has implications for the harvesting of electricity from anaerobic sediments and the bioremediation of oxidized contaminants.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates, for the first time, the proof-of-principle of an MEC in which both the anodic and cathodic reaction are catalyzed by microorganisms. No expensive chemical catalysts, such as platinum, are needed. Two of these MECs were simultaneously operated and reached a maximum of 1.4 A/m(2) at an applied cell voltage of 0.5 V. At a cathode potential of -0.7 V, the biocathode in the MECs had a higher current density (MEC 1: 1.9 A/m(2), MEC 2: 3.3 A/m(2)) than a control cathode (0.3 A/m(2), graphite felt without biofilm) in an electrochemical half cell. This indicates that hydrogen production is catalyzed at the biocathode, likely by electrochemically active microorganisms. The cathodic hydrogen recovery was 17{\%} for MEC 1 and 21{\%} for MEC 2. Hydrogen losses were ascribed to diffusion through membrane and tubing, and methane formation. After 1600 h of operation, the current density of the MECs had decreased to 0.6 A/m(2), probably caused by precipitation of calcium phosphate on the biocathode. The slow deteriorating effect of calcium phosphate, and the production of methane show the importance of studying the combination of bioanode and biocathode in one electrochemical cell, and of studying long term performance of such an MEC.},

Nanowires produced by the oxygenic phototrophic cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 and the thermophilic, fermentative bacterium Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum reveal that electrically conductive appendages are not exclusive to dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria and may, in fact, represent a common bacterial strategy for efficient electron transfer and energy distribution.},

abstract = {Operation of microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) without an ion exchange membrane could help to lower the construction costs while lowering the ohmic cell resistance and improving MEC conversion rates by minimizing the pH gradient between anode and cathode. In this research, we demonstrate that membraneless MECs with plain graphite can be operated for methane production without pH adjustment and that the ohmic cell resistance could be lowered with approximately 50{\%} by removing the cation exchange membrane. As a result, the current production increased from 66 +/- 2 to 156 +/- 1 A m(-3) MEC by removing the membrane with an applied voltage of -0.8 V. Methane was the main energetic product despite continuous operation under carbonate-limited and slightly acidified conditions (pH 6.1-6.2). Our results suggest that continuous production of hydrogen in membraneless MECs will be challenging since methane production might not be avoided easily. The electrical energy invested was not always completely recovered under the form of an energy-rich biogas; however, our results indicate that membraneless MECs might be a viable polishing step for the treatment of the effluent of anaerobic digesters as methane was produced under low organic loading conditions and at room temperature.},

abstract = {New sustainable methods are needed to produce renewable energy carriers that can be stored and used for transportation, heating, or chemical production. Here we demonstrate that methane can directly be produced using a biocathode containing methanogens in electrochemical systems (abiotic anode) or microbial electrolysis cells (MECs; biotic anode) by a process called electromethanogenesis. At a set potential of less than -0.7 V (vs Ag/AgCl), carbon dioxide was reduced to methane using a two-chamber electrochemical reactor containing an abiotic anode, a biocathode, and no precious metal catalysts. At -1.0 V, the current capture efficiency was 96{\%}. Electrochemical measurements made using linear sweep voltammetry showed that the biocathode substantially increased current densities compared to a plain carbon cathode where only small amounts of hydrogen gas could be produced. Both increased current densities and very small hydrogen production rates by a plain cathode therefore support a mechanism of methane production directly from current and not from hydrogen gas. The biocathode was dominated by a single Archaeon, Methanobacterium palustre. When a current was generated by an exoelectrogenic biofilm on the anode growing on acetate in a single-chamber MEC, methane was produced at an overall energy efficiency of 80{\%} (electrical energy and substrate heat of combustion). These results show that electromethanogenesis can be used to convert electrical current produced from renewable energy sources (such as wind, solar, or biomass) into a biofuel (methane) as well as serving as a method for the capture of carbon dioxide.},

The decomposition pathway of acetate, a significant precursor of CH(4) and a key intermediate metabolite in the anaerobic digestion process, was analyzed by using stable isotopes. A tracer experiment using (13)C-labeled acetate revealed that approximately 80{\%} of the acetate was decomposed via a non-aceticlastic oxidative pathway, whereas the remainder was converted to methane via an aceticlastic pathway. Archaeal 16S rRNA analyses demonstrated that the hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanoculleus spp. accounted for {\textgreater}90{\%} of detected methanogens, and the aceticlastic methanogens Methanosarcina spp. were the minor constituents. The clone library targeting bacterial 16S rRNA indicated the predominance of the novel Thermotogales bacterium (relative abundance: {\~{}}53{\%}), which is related to anaerobic acetate oxidizer Thermotoga lettingae TMO, although the sequence similarity was low. Uncultured bacteria that phylogenetically belong to municipal solid waste cluster I were also predominant in the microflora ({\~{}}30{\%}). These results imply that the microbial community in the thermophilic degrading process of organic solid waste consists exclusively of unidentified bacteria, which efficiently remove acetate through a non-aceticlastic oxidative pathway.},

abstract = {The influence of temperature, 50 and 60 degrees C, at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 20 and 10 days, on the performance of anaerobic digestion of cow manure has been investigated in completely stirred tank reactors (CSTRs). Furthermore, the effect of both daily downward and daily upward temperature fluctuations has been studied. In the daily downward temperature fluctuation regime the temperatures of each reactor was reduced by 10 degrees C for 10 h while in the daily upward fluctuation regime the temperature of each reactor was increased 10 degrees C for 5 h. The results show that the methane production rate at 60 degrees C is lower than that at 50 degrees C at all experimental conditions of imposed HRT except when downward temperature fluctuations were applied at an HRT of 10 days. It also was found that the free ammonia concentration not only affects the acetate-utilising bacteria but also the hydrolysis and acidification process. The upward temperature fluctuation affects the maximum specific methanogenesis activity more severely as compared to imposed downward temperature fluctuations. The results clearly reveal the possibility of using available solar energy at daytime to heat up the reactor(s) without the need of heat storage during nights, especially at an operational temperature of 50 degrees C and at a 20 days HRT, and without the jeopardising of the overheating.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of methane fermentation treatment used in food waste processing is currently limited by solubilization and acidogenesis. In efforts to improve the treatment process, this study examined the effects of temperature on solubilization and acidogenesis. The solubilization rate of food waste, which was based on suspended solid removal, was 47.5{\%}, 62.2{\%}, 70.0{\%}, 72.7{\%}, 56.1{\%} and 45.9{\%} at 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 45 degrees C, 55 degrees C and 65 degrees C, respectively. Solubilization rate was accelerated from the middle to late experimental periods under mesophilic (35 degrees C and 45 degrees C) conditions. In contrast, overall solubilization rate was significantly lower under thermophilic (55 degrees C and 65 degrees C) conditions than under mesophilic conditions, although solubilization occurred rapidly in the early experimental period. The production of biogas was high under mesophilic conditions of 35 degrees C and 45 degrees C, at 64.7 and 62.7mL/g-VS, respectively, while it was scarce under thermophilic conditions. Solubilization of food waste was accelerated under both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions; however, solubilization rate was observed to be particularly high under mesophilic conditions, and a shortening of the hydraulic retention time is expected under thermophilic conditions.},

abstract = {In the present study the increase of the organic loading rate from 2.11 to 4.25 kg VS m(-3) d(-1) in a two stage, agricultural biogas plant was investigated. The process enhancement resulted in the doubling of the plant capacity from 500 kW to 1000 kW retaining the same digester volume. Efficiency criteria showed good performance throughout the study. At the end of the monitoring, biogas yield was on the same level as before the enhancement, while volume related biogas productivity almost doubled from 1.50 to 2.91 Nm(3) m(-3) d(-1). However, as a consequence of the higher transfer of poorly degraded organic material into the effluent, the residual methane potential of the effluent multiplied by the factor 10. The results of this study show, that most agricultural biogas plants in Austria have a great potential for a significant capacity increase. However, to avoid atmospheric emissions, the effluent storage of high loaded processes has to be integrated into the gas-tight system of the digesters.},

The heat treatment (103 degrees C for 24 h) of the compost from a cattle dung composting facility was able to select H2-producing spores; this product was used as a seed for continuous systems. The brewery waste was used as substrate. For the eight runs with combinations of five HRTs and four pHs, the results indicate that at pH=5.5, a maximum H2 production of 47{\%} H2 concentration, 43 ml H2/g COD(added), and 3.1 l H2/l reactor d was achieved at HRT=18 h. Nevertheless, at HRT=18 h, pH 5.5 was also the optimum pH for the maximum H2 production among four pHs evaluated from 5 to 6.5. There was a significant accumulation of volatile acid and alcohols during the entire study.},

abstract = {A modified three-stage methane fermentation system was developed to digest food waste efficiently. This system consisted of three stages: semianaerobic hydrolysis, anaerobic acidogenesis and strictly anaerobic methanogenesis. In this study, we examined the effects of temperature and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on the methanogenesis. Operation temperature was adjusted from 30 degrees C to 55 degrees C, and the HRTs ranged from 8 to 12 d. The rate of soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) removal correlated with digestion time according to the first-order kinetic model developed by Grau et al. [Water Res., 9, 637-642 (1975)]. With liquor food waste, thermophilic digesters showed a higher rate of sCOD removal than mesophilic digesters. The rates of biogas and methane production by thermophilic digesters were higher than those by mesophilic digesters regardless of HRT. Although maximum biogas production occurred when an HRT of 10 d was used, the methane yield was the highest in the reactor when an HRT of 12 d was used (223 l CH4/kg sCODdegraded). However, digestion stability decreased when an HRT of 8 d was used. The concentration of NH3-N generated in this experiment did not inhibit anaerobic digestion.},

abstract = {A total community DNA sample from an agricultural biogas reactor continuously fed with maize silage, green rye, and small proportions of chicken manure has recently been sequenced using massively parallel pyrosequencing. In this study, the sample was computationally characterized without a prior assembly step, providing quantitative insights into the taxonomic composition and gene content of the underlying microbial community. Clostridiales from the phylum Firmicutes is the most prevalent phylogenetic order, Methanomicrobiales are dominant among methanogenic archaea. An analysis of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) revealed that the entire microbial community is only partially covered by the sequenced sample, despite that estimates suggest only a moderate overall diversity of the community. Furthermore, the results strongly indicate that archaea related to the genus Methanoculleus, using CO2 as electron acceptor and H2 as electron donor, are the main producers of methane in the analyzed biogas reactor sample. A phylogenetic analysis of glycosyl hydrolase protein families suggests that Clostridia play an important role in the digestion of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. Finally, the results unveiled that most of the organisms constituting the sample are still unexplored.},

abstract = {Composition and gene content of a biogas-producing microbial community from a production-scale biogas plant fed with renewable primary products was analysed by means of a metagenomic approach applying the ultrafast 454-pyrosequencing technology. Sequencing of isolated total community DNA on a Genome Sequencer FLX System resulted in 616,072 reads with an average read length of 230 bases accounting for 141,664,289 bases sequence information. Assignment of obtained single reads to COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins) categories revealed a genetic profile characteristic for an anaerobic microbial consortium conducting fermentative metabolic pathways. Assembly of single reads resulted in the formation of 8752 contigs larger than 500 bases in size. Contigs longer than 10kb mainly encode house-keeping proteins, e.g. DNA polymerase, recombinase, DNA ligase, sigma factor RpoD and genes involved in sugar and amino acid metabolism. A significant portion of contigs was allocated to the genome sequence of the archaeal methanogen Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1. Mapping of single reads to the M. marisnigri JR1 genome revealed that approximately 64{\%} of the reference genome including methanogenesis gene regions are deeply covered. These results suggest that species related to those of the genus Methanoculleus play a dominant role in methanogenesis in the analysed fermentation sample. Moreover, assignment of numerous contig sequences to clostridial genomes including gene regions for cellulolytic functions indicates that clostridia are important for hydrolysis of cellulosic plant biomass in the biogas fermenter under study. Metagenome sequence data from a biogas-producing microbial community residing in a fermenter of a biogas plant provide the basis for a rational approach to improve the biotechnological process of biogas production.},

Compared to the control without feather addition, total CH(4) production increased by 130{\%} (P{\textless}0.001) and 110{\%} (P=0.09) in the swine manure and the slaughterhouse sludge digesters, respectively.

These results are reflective of feather digestion. Feather addition did not affect CH(4) yields of the swine manure digesters (P=0.082) and the slaughterhouse sludge digesters (P=0.21), indicating that feathers can be digested together with swine manure or slaughterhouse sludge without negatively affecting the digestion of swine manure and slaughterhouse sludge.},

abstract = {The two-phase leach-bed system is a biogas reactor system optimized for the utilization of energy crop silages at maximized loading rates under maintenance of an optimal microbial activity. In this study, a characterization of the methanogenic microbial community within this reactor system was conducted for the first time. Accordingly, effluent samples from the anaerobic filter and the silage digesting leach-bed reactors of both a laboratory-scale two-phase biogas reactor system and a scaled-up commercial on-farm pilot plant were investigated. In total, five Archaea-specific 16S rDNA libraries were constructed and analyzed by amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), with subsequent phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences for individual ARDRA patterns. A quantification of major methanogenic Archaea groups was conducted by real-time PCR. A total of 663 clones were analyzed and 45 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) related to methanogenic Archaea were detected. These OTUs were related to the orders Methanosarcinales, Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales, as well as the hitherto uncultured CA-11 and ARC-I groups, and most of them occurred throughout all the compartments of both two-phase biogas reactors. The proportion of acetotrophic to hydrogenotrophic methanogens differed between the laboratory and the pilot scale system. A total of 56{\%} of the clones from the 16S rDNA library derived from the laboratory biogas system were assigned to presumably acetotrophic members of Methanosarcinales. In contrast, these OTUs were less abundant in the 16S rDNA library derived from samples of the pilot plant. Therein, the most dominant OTUs were Methanoculleus-related OTUs, which presumably indicated the predominant presence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. These findings were confirmed by group-specific quantitative real-time PCR assays. The results indicated that the fraction of acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens within a biogas reactor caused certain variations, which may reflect varying substrate utilization during methanogenesis.},

The daily and weekly variations of food waste composition over a two-month period were measured. The anaerobic digestibility and biogas and methane yields of the food waste were evaluated using batch anaerobic digestion tests performed at 50 degrees C. The daily average moisture content (MC) and the ratio of volatile solids to total solids (VS/TS) determined from a week-long sampling were 70{\%} and 83{\%}, respectively, while the weekly average MC and VS/TS were 74{\%} and 87{\%}, respectively. The nutrient content analysis showed that the food waste contained well balanced nutrients for anaerobic microorganisms. The methane yield was determined to be 348 and 435 mL/gVS, respectively, after 10 and 28 days of digestion. The average methane content of biogas was 73{\%}. The average VS destruction was 81{\%} at the end of the 28-day digestion test. The results of this study indicate that the food waste is a highly desirable substrate for anaerobic digesters with regards to its high biodegradability and methane yield.},

abstract = {The possibility of limiting the global warming is strictly linked to the reduction of GHG emissions. Renewable energy both allows reducing emissions and permits to delay fossil fuel depletion. The anaerobic digestion of animal manure and energy crops is a promising way of reducing GHG emissions. In Italy agricultural biogas production was considerably increased; nowadays there are about 520 agricultural biogas plants. The increasing number of biogas plants, especially of those larger than 500 kW(e) (electrical power), involves a high consumption of energy crops, large transport distances of biomass and digestate and difficulties on thermal energy valorization. In this study the energetic (CED) and environmental (GHG emissions) profiles associated with the production of electricity derived from biogas have been identified. Three biogas plants located in Northern Italy have been analyzed. The study has been carried out considering a cradle-to-grave perspective and thus, special attention has been paid on the feedstock production and biogas production process. The influences on the results taking into account different plant sizes and feeding rate has been assessed in detail. Energy analysis was performed using the Cumulative Energy Demand method (CED). The climate change was calculated for a 100-year time frame based on GHG emissions indicated as CO2 equivalents (eq) and defined by the IPCC (2006). In comparison to the fossil reference system, the electricity production using biogas saves GHG emissions from 0.188 to 1.193 kg CO2eq per kWh(e). Electricity supply from biogas can also contribute to a considerable reduction of the use of fossil energy carriers (from -3.97 to 10.08 MJ(fossil) per kWh(e)). The electricity production from biogas has a big potential for energy savings and reduction of GHG emissions. Efficient utilization of the cogenerated heat can substantially improve the GHG balance of electricity production from biogas.},

abstract = {Methanosarcina sp. strain TM-1, an acetotrophic, thermophilic methanogen isolated from an anaerobic sludge digestor, was originally reported to require an anaerobic sludge supernatant for growth. It was found that the sludge supernatant could be replaced with yeast extract (1 g/liter), 6 mM bicarbonate-30{\%} CO(2), and trace metals, with a doubling time on methanol of 14 h. For growth on either methanol or acetate, yeast extract could be replaced with CaCl(2) . 2H(2)O (13.6 muM minimum) and the vitamin p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA, ca. 3 nM minimum), with a doubling time on methanol of 8 to 9 h. Filter-sterilized folic acid at 0.3 muM could not replace PABA. The antimetabolite sulfanilamide (20 mM) inhibited growth of and methanogenesis by Methanosarcina sp. strain TM-1, and this inhibition was reversed by the addition of 0.3 muM PABA. When a defined medium buffered with 20 mM N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid was used, it was shown that Methanosarcina sp. strain TM-1 required 6 mM bicarbonate-30{\%} CO(2) for optimal growth and methanogenesis from methanol. Cells growing on acetate were less dependent on bicarbonate-CO(2). When we used a defined medium in which the only organic compounds present were methanol or acetate, nitrilotriacetic acid (0.2 mM), and PABA, it was possible to limit batch cultures of Methanosarcina sp. strain TM-1 for nitrogen at NH(4) concentrations at or below 2.0 mM, in marked contrast with Methanosarcina barkeri 227, which fixes dinitrogen when grown under NH(4) limitation.},

The biomass was investigated at a molecular level to determine the links between the operational parameters of anaerobic digestion and methanogenic Archaea structure. The highest production of biogas with methane content of ca. 67{\%} was noted in the mesophilic microwave-heated reactors. The production of methane-rich biogas and the overall diversity of Archaea was determined by Methanosarcinaceae presence. The temperature and the application of microwaves were the main factors explaining the variations in the methanogen community. At 35 °C, the microwave heating stimulated the growth of highly diverse methanogen assemblages, promoting Methanosarcina barkeri presence and excluding Methanosarcina harudinacea from the biomass. A temperature increase to 55 °C lowered Methanosarcinaceae abundance and induced a replacement of Methanoculleus palmolei by Methanosarcina thermophila.},

Of the 17 substrates tested, only formate and H(2) plus CO(2) supported growth. An unidentified, heat-stable factor(s) was required by the organism. The factor, which was not one of the common ones, was present in rumen fluid, mixed rumen bacteria, and yeast extract.

abstract = {The Zoige wetland of the Tibetan plateau is at permanent low temperatures and is a methane emission heartland of the plateau; however, cold-adaptive methanogens in the soil are poorly understood. In this study, a variety of methanogenic enrichments at 15 degrees C and 30 degrees C were obtained from the wetland soil. It was demonstrated that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the most efficient type at 30 degrees C, while methanol supported the highest methanogenesis rate at 15 degrees C. Moreover, methanol was the only substrate to produce methane more efficiently at 15 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. A novel psychrophilic methanogen, strain R15, was isolated from the methanol enrichment at 15 degrees C. Phylogenetic analysis placed strain R15 within the genus Methanolobus, loosely clustered with Methanolobus taylorii (96.7{\%} 16S rRNA similarity). R15 produced methane from methanol, trimethylamine, and methyl sulfide and differed from other Methanolobus species by growing and producing methane optimally at 18 degrees C (specific growth rate of 0.063 +/- 0.001 h(-1)) and even at 0 degrees C. Based on these characteristics, R15 was proposed to be a new species and named "Methanolobus psychrophilus" sp. nov. The K(m) and V(max) of R15 for methanol conversion were determined to be 87.5 +/- 0.4 microM and 0.39 +/- 0.04 mM h(-1) at 18 degrees C, respectively, indicating a high affinity and conversion efficiency for methanol. The proportion of R15 in the soil was determined by quantitative PCR, and it accounted for 17.2{\%} +/- 2.1{\%} of the total archaea, enumerated as 10(7) per gram of soil; the proportion was increased to 42.4{\%} +/- 2.3{\%} in the methanol enrichment at 15 degrees C. This study suggests that the psychrophilic methanogens in the Zoige wetland are likely to be methylotrophic and to play a role in methane emission of the wetland.},

abstract = {Characteristics of an obligately methylotrophic coccoid methanogen (strain GS-16) previously isolated from estuarine sediment are described. Growth was demonstrated on dimethyl sulfide (DMS) or trimethylamine (TMA), but not on methane thiol, methane thiol plus hydrogen, dimethyl disulfide, or methionine. DMS-grown cells were able to metabolize DMS and TMA simultaneously when inoculated into media containing substrate levels of these compounds. However, TMA-grown cells could not metabolize [C]DMS to CH(4), although they could convert [C]methanol to CH(4). These results suggest that metabolism of DMS proceeds along a somewhat different route than that of TMA and perhaps also that of methanol. The organism exhibited doubling times of 23 and 32 h for growth (25 degrees C) in mineral media on TMA and DMS, respectively. Doubling times were more rapid ( approximately 6 h) when the organisms were grown on TMA in complex broth. In mineral media, the fastest growth on DMS occurred between pH levels of 7.0 and 8.7, at 29 degrees C, and with 0.2 to 0.4 M Na and 0.04 M Mg. Somewhat different results occurred for growth on TMA in complex broth. Cells had a moles percent G+C value of 44.5{\%} for their DNA. Growth on DMS, TMA, and methanol yielded stable carbon isotope fractionation factors of 1.044, 1.037, and 1.063, respectively. Fractionation factors for hydrogen were 1.203 (DMS) and 1.183 (TMA).},

Acetate was not required for cell growth. Trace amounts of tungstate promoted cell growth. The G+C contents of DNA of Methanofollis aquaemaris N2F9704(T) and strain ML15(T) were 59.1 and 58.4 mol{\%}, respectively. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of strain ML15(T) and selected Methanofollis species revealed similarities of 95-97 {\%}.

The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was 88.2{\%} with a CH(4) yield of 0.25L/(g COD(removed)) when organic loading rate (OLR) was 5.4kg CODm(-3)d(-1). C1 played the most important role in solvents (acetone, butanol and ethanol) and COD removal. Community structure of C2 was similar to that in C1 at stage 3 with higher OLR, but was similar to those in C3 and C4 at stages 1-2 with lower OLR. This community variation in C2 was consistent with its increased role in COD and solvent removal at stage 3. During community succession from C1 to C4 at stage 3, abundance of Firmicutes (especially OTUs ABRB07 and ABRB10) and Methanoculleus decreased, while Bacteroidetes and Methanocorpusculum became dominant. Thus, ABRB07 coupled with Methanoculleus and/or acetogen (ABRB10) may be key species for solvents degradation.},

abstract = {Archaea (archaebacteria) are a phenotypically diverse group of microorganisms that share a common evolutionary history. There are four general phenotypic groups of archaea: the methanogens, the extreme halophiles, the sulfate-reducing archaea, and the extreme thermophiles. In the marine environment, archaeal habitats are generally limited to shallow or deep-sea anaerobic sediments (free-living and endosymbiotic methanogens), hot springs or deep-sea hydrothermal vents (methanogens, sulfate reducers, and extreme thermophiles), and highly saline land-locked seas (halophiles). This report provides evidence for the widespread occurrence of unusual archaea in oxygenated coastal surface waters of North America. Quantitative estimates indicated that up to 2{\%} of the total ribosomal RNA extracted from coastal bacterioplankton assemblages was archaeal. Archaeal small-subunit ribosomal RNA-encoding DNAs (rDNAs) were cloned from mixed bacterioplankton populations collected at geographically distant sampling sites. Phylogenetic and nucleotide signature analyses of these cloned rDNAs revealed the presence of two lineages of archaea, each sharing the diagnostic signatures and structural features previously established for the domain Archaea. Both of these lineages were found in bacterioplankton populations collected off the east and west coasts of North America. The abundance and distribution of these archaea in oxic coastal surface waters suggests that these microorganisms represent undescribed physiological types of archaea, which reside and compete with aerobic, mesophilic eubacteria in marine coastal environments.},

abstract = {We generated draft genome sequences for two cold-adapted Archaea, Methanogenium frigidum and Methanococcoides burtonii, to identify genotypic characteristics that distinguish them from Archaea with a higher optimal growth temperature (OGT). Comparative genomics revealed trends in amino acid and tRNA composition, and structural features of proteins. Proteins from the cold-adapted Archaea are characterized by a higher content of noncharged polar amino acids, particularly Gln and Thr and a lower content of hydrophobic amino acids, particularly Leu. Sequence data from nine methanogen genomes (OGT 15 degrees -98 degrees C) were used to generate 1111 modeled protein structures. Analysis of the models from the cold-adapted Archaea showed a strong tendency in the solvent-accessible area for more Gln, Thr, and hydrophobic residues and fewer charged residues. A cold shock domain (CSD) protein (CspA homolog) was identified in M. frigidum, two hypothetical proteins with CSD-folds in M. burtonii, and a unique winged helix DNA-binding domain protein in M. burtonii. This suggests that these types of nucleic acid binding proteins have a critical role in cold-adapted Archaea. Structural analysis of tRNA sequences from the Archaea indicated that GC content is the major factor influencing tRNA stability in hyperthermophiles, but not in the psychrophiles, mesophiles or moderate thermophiles. Below an OGT of 60 degrees C, the GC content in tRNA was largely unchanged, indicating that any requirement for flexibility of tRNA in psychrophiles is mediated by other means. This is the first time that comparisons have been performed with genome data from Archaea spanning the growth temperature extremes from psychrophiles to hyperthermophiles.},

Methanogenic archaea are ubiquitous on earth and produce a large amount of methane (CH(4)) as their main carbon metabolite. Methanogens are the most laboratory amendable archaea. The few psychrophilic archaea that have been cultured to date are mainly affiliated with methanogens, thus make them a good model for investigating mechanisms of archaeal cold adaptation. Studies of psychrotolerant methanogens have been ongoing since the 1990s. Using Methanococcoides burtonii, a methanogen isolated from Ace Lake in Antarctica, extensive studies on the genomic characteristics associated with cold adaptation have been carried out by the Cavicchioli laboratory. We recently analyzed the genome of another psychrophilic methanogen and identified the gene repertoire associated with cold adaptation. This review summarizes recent studies of psychroactive methanogens, particularly their diversity, the genomics and proteomics associated with their cold adaptation, and the cellular components and proteins likely involved in their cold protection.},

abstract = {Archaea are abundant and drive critical microbial processes in the Earth's cold biosphere. Despite this, not enough is known about the molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation and no biochemical studies have been performed on stenopsychrophilic archaea (e.g., Methanogenium frigidum). This study examined the structural and functional properties of cold shock proteins (Csps) from archaea, including biochemical analysis of the Csp from M. frigidum. csp genes are present in most bacteria and some eucarya but absent from most archaeal genome sequences, most notably, those of all archaeal thermophiles and hyperthermophiles. In bacteria, Csps are small, nucleic acid binding proteins involved in a variety of cellular processes, such as transcription. In this study, archaeal Csp function was assessed by examining the ability of csp genes from psychrophilic and mesophilic Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota to complement a cold-sensitive growth defect in Escherichia coli. In addition, an archaeal gene with a cold shock domain (CSD) fold but little sequence identity to Csps was also examined. Genes encoding Csps or a CSD structural analog from three psychrophilic archaea rescued the E. coli growth defect. The three proteins were predicted to have a higher content of solvent-exposed basic residues than the noncomplementing proteins, and the basic residues were located on the nucleic acid binding surface, similar to their arrangement in E. coli CspA. The M. frigidum Csp was purified and found to be a single-domain protein that folds by a reversible two-state mechanism and to exhibit a low conformational stability typical of cold-adapted proteins. Moreover, M. frigidum Csp was characterized as binding E. coli single-stranded RNA, consistent with its ability to complement function in E. coli. The studies show that some Csp and CSD fold proteins have retained sufficient similarity throughout evolution in the Archaea to be able to function effectively in the Bacteria and that the function of the archaeal proteins relates to cold adaptation. The initial biochemical analysis of M. frigidum Csp has developed a platform for further characterization and demonstrates the potential for expanding molecular studies of proteins from this important archaeal stenopsychrophile.},

Understanding of microbial community composition within the biogas reactors may improve the methane production from biomass fermentation. In this study, methanogenic archaea diverity of a biogas reactor supplied with swine feces as mono-substrate under mesophilic conditions was investigated. Community composition was determined by analysis of methyl coenzyme reductase subunit A gene (mcrA) clone library consisting of 123 clones. Statistical analysis of mcrA library indicated that all major groups of methanogens from our biogas reactor were detected. In the library, 57.7{\%} clones were affiliated to Methanobacteriales, 34.2{\%} to Methanomicrobiales, 2.4{\%} to Methanosarcinales and about 5.7{\%} clones belonged to unclassified euryarchaeota. Over 90{\%} of the methanogenic archaea from our biogas reactor were postulated to be hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Comparing with other previous studies reporting that hydrogenotrophic methanogens are dominant species in the biogas plants, this study firstly reported that Methanobacteriales instead of Methanomicrobiales are the most predominant methanogenic archaea in the biogas reactor fed with swine feces as sole substrate.},

abstract = {We live on a cold planet where more than 80{\%} of the biosphere is permanently below 5 degrees C, and yet comparatively little is known about the genetics and physiology of the microorganisms inhabiting these environments. Based on molecular probe and sequencing studies, it is clear that Archaea are numerically abundant in diverse low-temperature environments throughout the globe. In addition, non-low-temperature-adapted Archaea are commonly exposed to sudden decreases in temperature, as are other microorganisms, animals, and plants. Considering their ubiquity in nature, it is perhaps surprising to find that there is such a lack of knowledge regarding low-temperature adaptation mechanisms in Archaea, particularly in comparison to what is known about archaeal thermophiles and hyperthermophiles and responses to heat shock. This review covers what is presently known about adaptation to cold shock and growth at low temperature, with a particular focus on Antarctic Archaea. The review highlights the similarities and differences that exist between Archaea and Bacteria and eukaryotes, and addresses the potentially important role that protein synthesis plays in adaptation to the cold. By reviewing the present state of the field, a number of important areas for future research are identified.},

abstract = {Since the first microbial genome was sequenced in 1995, 30 others have been completed and an additional 99 are known to be in progress. Although the early emphasis of microbial genomics was on human pathogens for obvious reasons, a significant number of sequencing projects have focused on nonpathogenic organisms, beginning with the release of the complete genome sequence of the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii in 1996. The past 18 months have seen the completion of the genomes of several unusual organisms, including Thermotoga maritima, whose genome reveals extensive potential lateral transfer with archaea; Deinococcus radiodurans, the most radiation-resistant microorganism known; and Aeropyrum pernix, the first Crenarchaeota to be completely sequenced. Although the functional characterization of genomic data is still in its initial stages, it is likely that microbial genomics will have a significant impact on environmental, food, and industrial biotechnology as well as on genomic medicine.},

abstract = {The ability of cold-adapted microorganisms (generally referred to as psychrophiles) to survive is the result of molecular evolution and adaptations which, together, counteract the potentially deleterious effects of low kinetic energy environments and the freezing of water. These physiological adaptations are seen at many levels. Against a background of detailed comparative protein structural analyses, the recent surge of psychrophile proteome, genome, metagenome and transcriptome sequence data has triggered a series of sophisticated analyses of changes in global protein composition. These studies have revealed consistent and statistically robust changes in amino acid composition, interpreted as evolutionary mechanisms designed to destabilise protein structures, as well as identifying the presence of novel genes involved in cold adaptation.},

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analyses of 13CH3OH-12CO2 label incorporation by the cells provide information on the biosynthetic pathways of these organic osmolytes. The labeling studies indicate that Methanohalophilus strain FDF1 produces glutamate and beta-glutamine via a partial oxidative Krebs pathway. 13C labeling of betaine is consistent with methylation of glycine generated from serine (via serine hydroxymethyltransferase). The labeling pattern for N epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine is consistent with the synthesis of its precursor alpha-lysine occurring by the diaminopimelate pathway in these cells.},

abstract = {The unusual compound beta-aminoglutaric acid (beta-glutamate) has been identified by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in soluble extracts of marine methanogenic bacteria. We examined several methanogen species representing nine genera and found that beta-glutamate occurred in methanococci and two methanogenium strains (Methanogenium cariaci JR1 and "Methanogenium anulus" AN9). The presence of this compound in the methanococci examined was further restricted to thermophilic members of the genus Methanococcus, including Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus strains, Methanococcus jannaschii, and "Methanococcus igneus." The two Methanogenium strains examined were mesophiles. Studies using Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus showed that levels of beta-glutamate in cells of that species were not affected by variation in growth temperature (40 to 65 degrees C), NH4+ (2 to 80 mM), Mg2+ (10 to 50 mM), or K+ (2 to 10 mM) in the medium. In contrast, soluble pools of beta-glutamate and L-alpha-glutamate (the other major free amino acid in all the methanococci) were proportional to NaCl levels in the growth medium. This dependence of beta-glutamate and L-alpha-glutamate concentrations on salt levels in the medium suggests that they function as osmolytes in these cells.},

abstract = {A method based on sequence-specific cleavage of rRNA with ribonuclease H was used to detect almost all known cultivable methanogens in anaerobic biological treatment systems. To do so, a total of 40 scissor probes in different phylogeny specificities were designed or modified from previous studies, optimized for their specificities under digestion conditions with 32 methanogenic reference strains, and then applied to detect methanogens in sludge samples taken from 6 different anaerobic treatment processes. Among these processes, known aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic groups of methanogens from the families Methanosarcinaceae, Methanosaetaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanothermaceae and Methanocaldococcaceae could be successfully detected and identified down to the genus level. Within the aceticlastic methanogens, the abundances of mesophilic Methanosaeta accounted for 5.7-48.5{\%} of the total archaeal populations in mesophilic anaerobic processes, and those of Methanosarcina represented 41.7{\%} of the total archaeal populations in thermophilic processes. For hydrogenotrophic methanogens, members of the Methanomicrobiales, Methanobrevibacter and Methanobacterium were detected in mesophilic processes (1.2-17.2{\%}), whereas those of Methanothermobacter, Methanothermaceae and Methanocaldococcaceae were detected in thermophilic process (2.0-4.8{\%}). Overall results suggested that those hierarchical scissor probes developed could be effective for rapid and possibly on-site monitoring of targeted methanogens in different microbial environments.},

The target-group specificity and temperature of dissociation for each probe were characterized. In general, the probes were very specific for the target methanogens and did not hybridize to the rRNAs of nontarget methanogens. Together, the eight probes circumscribe methanogens now represented in pure culture (with the exception of members of the family Methanothermaceae). Three probes are order specific; two identify members of the order Methanobacteriales, and one is specific for the order Methanococcales. The fourth probe encompasses three families belonging to the order Methanomicrobiales, the third order within the current classification. The fifth probe is specific for the remaining family within this order (Methanosarcinaceae). Three additional probes encompass different genera within the Methanosarcinaceae.},

Methanogenic archaea are ubiquitous on earth and produce a large amount of methane (CH(4)) as their main carbon metabolite. Methanogens are the most laboratory amendable archaea. The few psychrophilic archaea that have been cultured to date are mainly affiliated with methanogens, thus make them a good model for investigating mechanisms of archaeal cold adaptation. Studies of psychrotolerant methanogens have been ongoing since the 1990s. Using Methanococcoides burtonii, a methanogen isolated from Ace Lake in Antarctica, extensive studies on the genomic characteristics associated with cold adaptation have been carried out by the Cavicchioli laboratory. We recently analyzed the genome of another psychrophilic methanogen and identified the gene repertoire associated with cold adaptation. This review summarizes recent studies of psychroactive methanogens, particularly their diversity, the genomics and proteomics associated with their cold adaptation, and the cellular components and proteins likely involved in their cold protection.},

Understanding of microbial community composition within the biogas reactors may improve the methane production from biomass fermentation. In this study, methanogenic archaea diverity of a biogas reactor supplied with swine feces as mono-substrate under mesophilic conditions was investigated. Community composition was determined by analysis of methyl coenzyme reductase subunit A gene (mcrA) clone library consisting of 123 clones. Statistical analysis of mcrA library indicated that all major groups of methanogens from our biogas reactor were detected. In the library, 57.7{\%} clones were affiliated to Methanobacteriales, 34.2{\%} to Methanomicrobiales, 2.4{\%} to Methanosarcinales and about 5.7{\%} clones belonged to unclassified euryarchaeota. Over 90{\%} of the methanogenic archaea from our biogas reactor were postulated to be hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Comparing with other previous studies reporting that hydrogenotrophic methanogens are dominant species in the biogas plants, this study firstly reported that Methanobacteriales instead of Methanomicrobiales are the most predominant methanogenic archaea in the biogas reactor fed with swine feces as sole substrate.},

abstract = {A novel methane-producing archaeon, strain NOBI-1(T) was isolated from an anaerobic, propionate-degradation enrichment culture, which was originally obtained from a mesophilic methanogenic sludge digesting municipal sewage sludge. Cells were non-motile, rod-shaped, 0.7-1.0 microm by 2.0 microm, and formed multicellular filaments longer than 8 microm. Growth was observed between 35 and 55 degrees C (optimum 50 degrees C) and pH 6.7 and 8.0 (optimum pH 7.0). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.3 mol{\%}. The strain utilized H(2) and formate for growth and methane production. Based on comparative sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA gene and mcrA gene (encoding the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, a key enzyme in the methane-production pathway), strain NOBI-1(T) was affiliated with the order Methanomicrobiales, but it was significantly distant from any other known species within the order. The most closely related species based on 16S rRNA and mcrA gene sequence similarity were respectively 'Candidatus Methanoregula boonei' (93.7{\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Methanocorpusculum parvum (74.2{\%} deduced McrA amino acid sequence similarity to the type strain). These phenotypic and genetic properties justified the creation of a novel species of a new genus for the strain, for which we propose the name Methanolinea tarda gen. nov., sp. nov.

abstract = {A novel mesophilic, hydrogenotrophic methanogen, designated strain TNRT, was isolated from an anaerobic, propionate-degradation enrichment culture that was originally established from a rice field soil sample from Taiwan. Cells were non-motile rods, 2.0–6.5 µm long by 0.3 µm wide. Filamentous (up to about 100 µm) and coccoid (about 1 µm in diameter) cells were also observed in cultures in the late exponential phase of growth. Strain TNRT grew at 20–40 °C (optimally at 37 °C), at pH 6.5–7.4 (optimally at pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0–25 g NaCl l−1 (optimally at 0 g NaCl l−1). The strain utilized H2/CO2 and formate for growth and produced methane. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.4 mol{\%}. Based on sequences of both the 16S rRNA gene and the methanogen-specific marker gene mcrA, strain TNRT was related most closely to Methanolinea tarda NOBI-1T; levels of sequence similarities were 94.8 and 86.4 {\%}, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity indicates that strain TNRT and M. tarda NOBI-1T represent different species within the same genus. This is supported by shared phenotypic properties, including substrate usage and cell morphology, and differences in growth temperature. Based on these genetic and phenotypic properties, strain TNRT is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Methanolinea, for which the name Methanolinea mesophila sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is TNRT ( = NBRC 105659T = DSM 23604T). In addition, we also suggest family status for the E1/E2 group within the order Methanomicrobiales, for which the name Methanoregulaceae fam. nov. is proposed; the type genus of family is Methanoregula.},

abstract = {A methanogenic organism from the domain Archaea (SD1(T)) was isolated from saline water released from a coal seam located 926 m below the surface via a methane-producing well near Monroe, Louisiana, USA. Growth and methanogenesis were supported with methanol, monomethylamine, dimethylamine or trimethylamine, but not with dimethylsulfide, formate, acetate or H(2)/CO(2). Cells grew in high-salt minimal medium but growth was stimulated with yeast extract or tryptone. Cells were single, non-motile, irregular coccoids 0.5-1.0 microm in diameter and the cell wall contained protein. Conditions for the maximum rate of growth were 40-50 degrees C, 0.2-0.6 M NaCl, 100-{\textgreater}or=200 mM MgCl(2), and pH 7.0-8.0. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 42+/-1mol {\%}. A comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain SD1(T) was most closely related to Methanolobus oregonensis DSM 5435(T) with 96 {\%} gene sequence similarity.

abstract = {The Zoige wetland of the Tibetan plateau is at permanent low temperatures and is a methane emission heartland of the plateau; however, cold-adaptive methanogens in the soil are poorly understood. In this study, a variety of methanogenic enrichments at 15C and 30C were obtained from the wetland soil. It was demonstrated that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the most efficient type at 30C, while methanol supported the highest methanogenesis rate at 15C. Moreover, methanol was the only substrate to produce methane more efficiently at 15C than at 30C. A novel psychrophilic methanogen, strain R15, was isolated from the methanol enrichment at 15C. Phylogenetic analysis placed strain R15 within the genus Methanolobus, loosely clustered with Methanolobus taylorii (96.7{\%} 16S rRNA similarity). R15 produced methane from methanol, trimethylamine, and methyl sulfide and differed from other Methanolobus species by growing and producing methane optimally at 18C (specific growth rate of 0.063 0.001 h1) and even at 0C. Based on these characteristics, R15 was proposed to be a new species and named Methanolobus psychrophilus sp. nov. The Km and V max of R15 for methanol conversion were determined to be 87.5 0.4 $\mu$M and 0.39 0.04 mM h1 at 18C, respectively, indicating a high affinity and conversion efficiency for methanol. The proportion of R15 in the soil was determined by quantitative PCR, and it accounted for 17.2{\%} 2.1{\%} of the total archaea, enumerated as 107 per gram of soil; the proportion was increased to 42.4{\%} 2.3{\%} in the methanol enrichment at 15C. This study suggests that the psychrophilic methanogens in the Zoige wetland are likely to be methylotrophic and to play a role in methane emission of the wetland.},

abstract = {Previous studies suggested that methanol and acetate were the likely methanogenic precursors in the cold Zoige wetland. In this study, the contribution of the two substances to methanogenesis and the conversion in Zoige wetland were analyzed. It was determined that methanol supported the highest CH(4) formation rate in the enrichments of the soil grown with Eleocharis valleculosa, and even higher at 15 degrees C than at 30 degrees C; while hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was higher at 30 degrees C. Both methanol- and acetate-using methanogens were counted at the highest (10(7) g(-1)) in the soil, whereas methanol-using acetogens (10(8) g(-1)) were ten times more abundant than either methanol- or acetate-using methanogens. Both methanol and acetate were detected in the methanogenesis-inhibited soil samples, so that both could be the primary methanogenic precursors in E. valleculosa soil. However, the levels of methanol and acetate accumulated in 2-bromoethane-sulfonate (BES)- and CHCl(3)-treated soils were in reverse, i.e., higher methanol in CHCl(3)- and higher acetate in BES-treated soil, so that methanol-derived methanogenesis could be underestimated due to the consumption by acetogens. Analysis of the soil 16S rRNA genes revealed Acetobacterum bakii and Trichococcus pasteurii to be the dominant methanol-using acetogens in the soil, and a strain of T. pasteurii was isolated, which showed the high conversion of methanol to acetate at 15 degrees C.},

The cells were motile, irregular cocci (diameter, 0.9-1.2 microm) and occurred singly, in pairs, as tetracocci or (occasionally) as aggregates. Strain MobM(T) grew at 9-37 degrees C (optimally at 30 degrees C) and at pH 6.1-7.8 (optimally at pH 6.5). Sodium and magnesium were required for growth, at 0.1-1.0 M Na(+) (optimally at 0.35 M) and 10-400 mM Mg(2+) (optimally at 15-25 mM). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 42.4 mol{\%}. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the isolate is a member of the genus Methanolobus, but distinct from its closest neighbours, Methanolobus tindarius DSM 2278(T) (sequence similarity, 98.0 {\%}) and Methanolobus vulcani DSM 3029(T) (98.1 {\%}).

abstract = {We have determined the complete 1,694,969-nt sequence of the GC-rich genome of Methanopyrus kandleri by using a whole direct genome sequencing approach. This approach is based on unlinking of genomic DNA with the ThermoFidelase version of M. kandleri topoisomerase V and cycle sequencing directed by 2'-modified oligonucleotides (Fimers). Sequencing redundancy (3.3x) was sufficient to assemble the genome with less than one error per 40 kb. Using a combination of sequence database searches and coding potential prediction, 1,692 protein-coding genes and 39 genes for structural RNAs were identified. M. kandleri proteins show an unusually high content of negatively charged amino acids, which might be an adaptation to the high intracellular salinity. Previous phylogenetic analysis of 16S RNA suggested that M. kandleri belonged to a very deep branch, close to the root of the archaeal tree. However, genome comparisons indicate that, in both trees constructed using concatenated alignments of ribosomal proteins and trees based on gene content, M. kandleri consistently groups with other archaeal methanogens. M. kandleri shares the set of genes implicated in methanogenesis and, in part, its operon organization with Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicum. These findings indicate that archaeal methanogens are monophyletic. A distinctive feature of M. kandleri is the paucity of proteins involved in signaling and regulation of gene expression. Also, M. kandleri appears to have fewer genes acquired via lateral transfer than other archaea. These features might reflect the extreme habitat of this organism.},

abstract = {We report here a comparative analysis of the genome sequence of Methanosarcina barkeri with those of Methanosarcina acetivorans and Methanosarcina mazei. The genome of M. barkeri is distinguished by having an organization that is well conserved with respect to the other Methanosarcina spp. in the region proximal to the origin of replication, with interspecies gene similarities as high as 95{\%}. However, it is disordered and marked by increased transposase frequency and decreased gene synteny and gene density in the distal semigenome. Of the 3,680 open reading frames (ORFs) in M. barkeri, 746 had homologs with better than 80{\%} identity to both M. acetivorans and M. mazei, while 128 nonhypothetical ORFs were unique (nonorthologous) among these species, including a complete formate dehydrogenase operon, genes required for N-acetylmuramic acid synthesis, a 14-gene gas vesicle cluster, and a bacterial-like P450-specific ferredoxin reductase cluster not previously observed or characterized for this genus. A cryptic 36-kbp plasmid sequence that contains an orc1 gene flanked by a presumptive origin of replication consisting of 38 tandem repeats of a 143-nucleotide motif was detected in M. barkeri. Three-way comparison of these genomes reveals differing mechanisms for the accrual of changes. Elongation of the relatively large M. acetivorans genome is the result of uniformly distributed multiple gene scale insertions and duplications, while the M. barkeri genome is characterized by localized inversions associated with the loss of gene content. In contrast, the short M. mazei genome most closely approximates the putative ancestral organizational state of these species.},

abstract = {A novel extremely thermophilic, methane-producing archaeon was isolated from a black smoker chimney at the Kairei field in the Central Indian Ridge. Cells of this isolate were irregular cocci with several flagella; motility was not observed. Growth was observed between 55 and 83 degrees C (optimum of 75 degrees C; 30 min doubling time) and between pH 6.0 and 8.5 (optimum of pH 6.7). The isolate was a strictly anaerobic, methanogenic autotroph capable of using hydrogen and carbon dioxide as sole energy and carbon sources. Formate was utilized as an alternative energy source. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 33.3 mol{\%}. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the isolate was most closely related to Methanotorris igneus strain Kol 5T. The isolate, however, could be genetically differentiated from this species by DNA-DNA hybridization analysis and on the basis of its physiological properties. The name Methanotorris formicicus sp. nov. is proposed for this isolate; the type strain is Mc-S-70T (=JCM 11930T=ATCC BAA-687T).},

abstract = {A newly isolated methanogen, strain DMS1(T), is the first obligately anaerobic archaeon which was directly enriched and isolated from a freshwater sediment in defined minimal medium containing dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as the sole carbon and energy source. The use of a chemostat with a continuous DMS-containing gas stream as a method of enrichment, followed by cultivation in deep agar tubes, resulted in a pure culture. Since the only substrates utilized by strain DMS1(T) are methanol, methylamines, methanethiol (MT), and DMS, this organism is considered an obligately methylotrophic methanogen like most other DMS-degrading methanogens. Strain DMS1(T) differs from all other DMS-degrading methanogens, since it was isolated from a freshwater pond and requires NaCl concentrations (0 to 0.04 M) typical of the NaCl concentrations required by freshwater microorganisms for growth. DMS was degraded effectively only in a chemostat culture in the presence of low hydrogen sulfide and MT concentrations. Addition of MT or sulfide to the chemostat significantly decreased degradation of DMS. Transient accumulation of DMS in MT-amended cultures indicated that transfer of the first methyl group during DMS degradation is a reversible process. On the basis of its low level of homology with the most closely related methanogen, Methanococcoides burtonii (94.5{\%}), its position on the phylogenetic tree, its morphology (which is different from that of members of the genera Methanolobus, Methanococcoides, and Methanohalophilus), and its salt tolerance and optimum (which are characteristic of freshwater bacteria), we propose that strain DMS1(T) is a representative of a novel genus. This isolate was named Methanomethylovorans hollandica. Analysis of DMS-amended sediment slurries with a fluorescence microscope revealed the presence of methanogens which were morphologically identical to M. hollandica, as described in this study. Considering its physiological properties, M. hollandica DMS1(T) is probably responsible for degradation of MT and DMS in freshwater sediments in situ. Due to the reversibility of the DMS conversion, methanogens like strain DMS1(T) can also be involved in the formation of DMS through methylation of MT. This phenomenon, which previously has been shown to occur in sediment slurries of freshwater origin, might affect the steady-state concentrations and, consequently, the total flux of DMS and MT in these systems.},

abstract = {Geological CO2 sequestration in unmineable subsurface oil/gas fields and coal formations has been proposed as a means of reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. However, the feasibility of injecting CO2 into subsurface depends upon a variety of geological and economic conditions, and the ecological consequences are largely unpredictable. In this study, we developed a new flow-through-type reactor system to examine potential geophysical, geochemical and microbiological impacts associated with CO2 injection by simulating in-situ pressure (0-100 MPa) and temperature (0-70°C) conditions. Using the reactor system, anaerobic artificial fluid and CO2 (flow rate: 0.002 and 0.00001 ml/min, respectively) were continuously supplemented into a column comprised of bituminous coal and sand under a pore pressure of 40 MPa (confined pressure: 41 MPa) at 40°C for 56 days. 16S rRNA gene analysis of the bacterial components showed distinct spatial separation of the predominant taxa in the coal and sand over the course of the experiment. Cultivation experiments using sub-sampled fluids revealed that some microbes survived, or were metabolically active, under CO2-rich conditions. However, no methanogens were activated during the experiment, even though hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogens were obtained from conventional batch-type cultivation at 20°C. During the reactor experiment, the acetate and methanol concentration in the fluids increased while the $\delta$(13)Cacetate, H2 and CO2 concentrations decreased, indicating the occurrence of homo-acetogenesis. 16S rRNA genes of homo-acetogenic spore-forming bacteria related to the genus Sporomusa were consistently detected from the sandstone after the reactor experiment. Our results suggest that the injection of CO2 into a natural coal-sand formation preferentially stimulates homo-acetogenesis rather than methanogenesis, and that this process is accompanied by biogenic CO2 conversion to acetate.},

abstract = {Biogenic formation of methane from coal is of great interest as an underexploited source of clean energy. The goal of some coal bed producers is to extend coal bed methane productivity and to utilize hydrocarbon wastes such as coal slurry to generate new methane. However, the process and factors controlling the process, and thus ways to stimulate it, are poorly understood. Subbituminous coal from a nonproductive well in south Texas was stimulated to produce methane in microcosms when the native population was supplemented with nutrients (biostimulation) or when nutrients and a consortium of bacteria and methanogens enriched from wetland sediment were added (bioaugmentation). The native population enriched by nutrient addition included Pseudomonas spp., Veillonellaceae, and Methanosarcina barkeri. The bioaugmented microcosm generated methane more rapidly and to a higher concentration than the biostimulated microcosm. Dissolved organics, including long-chain fatty acids, single-ring aromatics, and long-chain alkanes accumulated in the first 39 days of the bioaugmented microcosm and were then degraded, accompanied by generation of methane. The bioaugmented microcosm was dominated by Geobacter sp., and most of the methane generation was associated with growth of Methanosaeta concilii. The ability of the bioaugmentation culture to produce methane from coal intermediates was confirmed in incubations of culture with representative organic compounds. This study indicates that methane production could be stimulated at the nonproductive field site and that low microbial biomass may be limiting in situ methane generation. In addition, the microcosm study suggests that the pathway for generating methane from coal involves complex microbial partnerships.},

Hydrolytic (0.6-3.5 g COD g(-1) VSS d(-1)) and methanogenic (0.01-0.84 g COD g(-1) VSS d(-1)) activities depended on the type of biomass, whereas no significant differences were observed among the acidogenic activities (1.5-2.2 g COD g(-1) VSS d(-1)). In most cases, the higher the hydrolytic and the methanogenic activity, the higher the Bacteroidetes and Archaea percentages, respectively, in the biomasses. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity was always higher than acetoclastic methanogenic activity, and the highest values were achieved in those biomasses with lower percentages of Methanosaeta. In sum, the combination of molecular tools with activity tests seems to be essential for a better characterization of anaerobic biomasses.},

abstract = {Anaerobic digestion is the most successful bioenergy technology worldwide with, at its core, undefined microbial communities that have poorly understood dynamics. Here, we investigated the relationships of bacterial community structure ({\textgreater}400,000 16S rRNA gene sequences for 112 samples) with function (i.e., bioreactor performance) and environment (i.e., operating conditions) in a yearlong monthly time series of nine full-scale bioreactor facilities treating brewery wastewater ({\textgreater}20,000 measurements). Each of the nine facilities had a unique community structure with an unprecedented level of stability. Using machine learning, we identified a small subset of operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 145 out of 4,962), which predicted the location of the facility of origin for almost every sample (96.4{\%} accuracy). Of these 145 OTUs, syntrophic bacteria were systematically overrepresented, demonstrating that syntrophs rebounded following disturbances. This indicates that resilience, rather than dynamic competition, played an important role in maintaining the necessary syntrophic populations. In addition, we explained the observed phylogenetic differences between all samples on the basis of a subset of environmental gradients (using constrained ordination) and found stronger relationships between community structure and its function rather than its environment. These relationships were strongest for two performance variables—methanogenic activity and substrate removal efficiency—both of which were also affected by microbial ecology because these variables were correlated with community evenness (at any given time) and variability in phylogenetic structure (over time), respectively. Thus, we quantified relationships between community structure and function, which opens the door to engineer communities with superior functions. },

The strain grew at 25-45 °C (optimum 37-42 °C), at pH 5.8-8.2 (optimum pH 6.7-6.8) and in the presence of 0-1.3 M NaCl (optimum 0.1-0.2 M NaCl).

Values for DNA-DNA hybridization with type strains of closely related Methanoculleus species were less than 50 {\%}. Phenotypic and phylogenetic features of strain T10(T) clearly indicate that it represents a novel species of the genus Methanoculleus, for which the name Methanoculleus horonobensis sp. nov. is proposed.

abstract = {During attempts to obtain novel, human-associated species of the domain Archaea, a coccoid micro-organism, designated strain B10(T), was isolated in pure culture from a sample of human faeces collected in Marseille, France. On the basis of its phenotypic characteristics and 16S rRNA and mcrA gene sequences, the novel strain was classified as a methanogenic archaeon. Cells of the strain were non-motile, Gram-staining-positive cocci that were approximately 850 nm in diameter and showed autofluorescence at 420 nm. Cells were lysed by 0.1{\%} (w/v) SDS. With hydrogen as the electron donor, strain B10(T) produced methane by reducing methanol. The novel strain was unable to produce methane when hydrogen or methanol was the sole energy source. In an atmosphere containing CO(2), strain B10(T) could not produce methane from formate, acetate, trimethylamine, 2-butanol, 2-propanol, cyclopentanol, 2-pentanol, ethanol, 1-propanol or 2,3-butanediol. Strain B10(T) grew optimally with 0.5-1.0{\%} (w/v) NaCl, at pH 7.6 and at 37 °C. It required tungstate-selenite for growth. The complete genome of the novel strain was sequenced; the size of the genome was estimated to be 2.05 Mb and the genomic DNA G+C content was 59.93 mol{\%}. In phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, the highest sequence similarities (98.0-98.7{\%}) were seen between strain B10(T) and several uncultured, methanogenic Archaea that had been collected from the digestive tracts of a cockroach, a chicken and mammals. In the same analysis, the non-methanogenic 'Candidatus Aciduliprofundum boonei' DSM 19572 was identified as the cultured micro-organism that was most closely related to strain B10(T) (83.0{\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Each of the three treeing algorithms used in the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain B10(T) belongs to a novel order that is distinct from the Thermoplasmatales. The novel strain also appeared to be distinct from Methanosphaera stadtmanae DSM 3091(T) (72.9{\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), another methanogenic archaeon that was isolated from human faeces and can use methanol in the presence of hydrogen. Based on the genetic and phenotypic evidence, strain B10(T) represents a novel species of a new genus for which the name Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is B10(T) ( = DSM 24529(T) = CSUR P135(T)).},

The strain was isolated through construction of an artificial butyrate-degrading consortium in co-culture with a syntrophic bacterium, 'Syntrophomonas erecta subsp. sporosyntropha' JCM 13344. Cells of strain HC(T) were irregular coccoids, 0.8-2 mum in diameter, that occurred singly and utilized only H(2)/CO(2) for growth and methane production. Growth occurred at 18-45 degrees C (optimum around 37 degrees C). The pH for growth was 5.0-8.5 (optimal growth around pH 6.6). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 60.2 mol{\%}. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain HC(T) was affiliated to the genus Methanoculleus, with sequence similarities of 94.8-97.2 {\%} to existing members. However, strain HC(T) was distinguished from described Methanoculleus species by not using formate for growth or methane formation and not requiring acetate as a growth factor. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic characteristics, the novel species Methanoculleus hydrogenitrophicus sp. nov. is proposed, with strain HC(T) (=CGMCC 1.5146(T) =JCM 16311(T)) as the type strain.},

abstract = {In recent years considerable effort has been made in the Netherlands toward the development of a more sophisticated anaerobic treatment process, suitable for treating low a strength wastes and for applications at liquid detention times of 3–4 hr. The efforts have resulted in new type of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) process, which in recent 6 m3 pilot-plant experiments has shown to be capable of handling organic space loads of 15–40 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD){\textperiodcentered}m−3/day at 3–8 hr liquid detention times. In the first 200 m3 full-scale plant of the UASB concept, organic space loadings of up to 16 kg COD{\textperiodcentered}m−3/day could be treated satisfactorily at a detention times of 4 hr, using sugar beet waste as feed. The main results obtained with the process in the laboratory as well as in 6 m3 pilot plant and 200 m3 full-scale experiments are presented and evaluated in this paper. Special attention is given to the main operating characteristics of the UASB reactor concept. Moreover, some preliminary results are presented of laboratory experiments concerning the use of the USB reactor concept for denitrification as well as for the acid formation step in anaerobic treatment. For both purposes the process looks feasible because very satisfactory results with respect to denitrification and acid formation can be achieved at very high hydraulic loads (12 day−1) and high organic loading rates, i.e., 20 kg COD{\textperiodcentered}m−3/day in the denitrification and 60–80 kg COD{\textperiodcentered}m−3/day in the acid formation experiments.},

abstract = {The genomic GC-content of bacteria varies dramatically, from less than 20{\%} to more than 70{\%}. This variation is generally ascribed to differences in the pattern of mutation between bacteria. Here we test this hypothesis by examining patterns of synonymous polymorphism using datasets from 149 bacterial species. We find a large excess of synonymous GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations segregating in all but the most AT-rich bacteria, across a broad range of phylogenetically diverse species. We show that the excess of GC→AT mutations is inconsistent with mutation bias, since it would imply that most GC-rich bacteria are declining in GC-content; such a pattern would be unsustainable. We also show that the patterns are probably not due to translational selection or biased gene conversion, because optimal codons tend to be AT-rich, and the excess of GC→AT SNPs is observed in datasets with no evidence of recombination. We therefore conclude that there is selection to increase synonymous GC-content in many species. Since synonymous GC-content is highly correlated to genomic GC-content, we further conclude that there is selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria.},

Depth distributions of H2 partial pressure, along with a suite of relevant concentration data, were determined in sediment cores collected in November (at 14.5°C) and August (at 27°C) and used to calculate free energy yields for methanogenesis and sulfate reduction. At both times of year, and for both processes, free energy yields gradually decreased (became less negative) with depth before reaching an apparent asymptote. Sulfate-reducing bacteria exhibited an asymptote of −19.1±1.7 kJ (mol SO2−4)−1, while methanogenic Archaea were apparently supported by energy yields as small as −10.6±0.7 kJ (mol CH4)−1.},

The appetite of the Svalbard reindeer peaks in August (summer) and is at its lowest in March (winter). Microbial numbers, quantified by real-time PCR, did not change significantly between October and April, when food intakes are at similar levels, although the numbers of methanogens tended to be higher in October (P=0.074), and ciliate numbers tended to be higher in April (P=0.055). Similarly, no change was detected in the bacterial and protozoal population composition by rRNA gene-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis. Dominant methanogens were identified using a 16S rRNA gene library (97 clones) prepared from pooled PCR products from reindeer on October pasture (n=5). Eleven of the 22 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) generated exhibited a high degree of sequence similarity to methanogens affiliated with Methanobacteriales (eight OTUs), Methanomicrobiales (one OTU) and Methanosarcinales (two OTUs). The remaining 11 OTUs (53{\%} of the clones) were associated with a cluster of uncultivated ruminal archaea. This study has provided important insights into the rumen microbiome of a high-arctic herbivorous animal living under harsh nutritional conditions, and evidence suggesting that host type affects the population size of ruminal methanogens.},

Recently, Mx-01, a new phylotype hypothesized to belong to a putative sixth methanogenic order, was recovered from human faeces. Here we examined the diversity and the distribution of methanogens among healthy people of three age groups by analysing mcrA and 16S rDNA clones. The mcrA analysis of ∼1200 clones revealed that the usual Methanobacteriales were present without any significant difference among adults and elderly (respectively 60{\%} and 80{\%} of carriers, n = 40, P = 0.3). In addition, four new phylotypes that grouped with Mx-01 in the same monophyletic clade were recovered. These phylotypes were significantly more frequently detected in elderly people (40{\%}, n = 20) than in adults (10{\%}, n = 20, P = 0.065). In parallel, new 16S rDNA phylotypes affiliated near or within Thermoplasmatales were recovered. Altogether, these results indicate an age-related apparition of Mx-phylotypes, putatively methanogenic, which are formed of several species carrying a mcrA gene and that are not related to any of the five methanogenic orders. These species may be related to Thermoplasmatales or may cohabit with archaeal species related to Thermoplasmatales.},

We investigated the composition of archaeal communities in the rumens of farmed sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos taurus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to generate fingerprints of archaeal 16S rRNA genes. The total archaeal communities were relatively constant across species and diets, and were less variable and less diverse than bacterial communities. There were diet- and ruminant-species-based differences in archaeal community structure, but the same dominant archaea were present in all rumens. These were members of three coherent clades: species related to Methanobrevibacter ruminantium and Methanobrevibacter olleyae; species related to Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii, Methanobrevibacter thaueri and Methanobrevibacter millerae; and species of the genus Methanosphaera. Members of an archaeal group of unknown physiology, designated rumen cluster C (RCC), were also present. RCC-specific DGGE, clone library analysis and quantitative real-time PCR showed that their 16S rRNA gene sequences were very diverse and made up an average of 26.5{\%} of the total archaea. RCC sequences were not readily detected in the DGGE patterns of total archaeal 16S rRNA genes because no single sequence type was abundant enough to form dominant bands.},

abstract = {Two mesophilic methanogenic strains, designated TS-2(T) and GH(T), were isolated from sediments of Tuosu lake and Gahai lake, respectively, in the Qaidam basin, Qinghai province, China. Cells of both isolates were rods (about 0.3-0.5×2-5 µm) with blunt rounded ends and Gram-staining-positive. Strain TS-2(T) was motile with one or two polar flagella and used only H(2)/CO(2) for growth and methanogenesis. Strain GH(T) was non-motile, used both H(2)/CO(2) and formate and displayed a variable cell arrangement depending on the substrate: long chains when growing in formate (50 mM) or under high pressure H(2) and single cells under low pressure H(2). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the two isolates in the genus Methanobacterium. Strain TS-2(T) was most closely related to Methanobacterium alcaliphilum NBRC 105226(T) (96{\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Phylogenetic analysis based on the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase also supported the affiliation of the two isolates with the genus Methanobacterium. DNA-DNA relatedness between the isolates and M. alcaliphilum DSM 3387(T) was 39-53{\%}. Hence we propose two novel species, Methanobacterium movens sp. nov. (type strain TS-2(T)=AS 1.5093(T)=JCM 15415(T)) and Methanobacterium flexile sp. nov. (type strain GH(T)=AS 1.5092(T)=JCM 15416(T)).},

Cells of strain 169(T) were non-motile, Gram-reaction-variable and rod-shaped or slightly curved rods with rounded ends (1.6-5.0 × 0.35-0.5 µm).

Ultrathin sections showed a single-layered, electron-dense cell wall about 6 nm thick, which is typical of Gram-positive bacteria. Growth was observed at 15 °C-45 °C (optimum 40 °C), at pH 6.5-9.6 (optimum pH 7.5-8.5) and in 0-70 g NaCl l(-1) (0-1.2 M) (optimum 5 g NaCl l(-1); 0.086 M). Strain 169(T) utilized only hydrogen and carbon dioxide as energy and carbon sources. The DNA G+C content was 39.3 mol{\%}.

abstract = {This study summarizes the findings of our research on the genesis of methane, its content and distribution in permafrost horizons of different age and origin. Supported by reliable data from a broad geographical sweep, these findings confirm the presence of methane in permanently frozen fine-grained sediments. In contrast to the omnipresence of carbon dioxide in permafrost, methane-containing horizons (up to 40.0 mL kg(-1)) alternate with strata free of methane. Discrete methane-containing horizons representing over tens of thousands of years are indicative of the absence of methane diffusion through the frozen layers. Along with the isotopic composition of CH(4) carbon (delta(13)C -64 per thousand to -99 per thousand), this confirms its biological origin and points to in situ formation of this biogenic gas. Using (14)C-labeled substrates, the possibility of methane formation within permafrost was experimentally shown, as confirmed by delta(13)C values. Extremely low values (near -99 per thousand) indicate that the process of CH(4) formation is accompanied by the substantial fractionation of carbon isotopes. For the first time, cultures of methane-forming archaea, Methanosarcina mazei strain JL01 VKM B-2370, Methanobacterium sp. strain M2 VKM B-2371 and Methanobacterium sp. strain MK4 VKM B-2440 from permafrost, were isolated and described.},

abstract = {Among methanogens, only 2 genera, Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina, are known to contribute to methanogenesis from acetate, and Methanosaeta is a specialist that uses acetate specifically. However, Methanosaeta strains so far have mainly been isolated from anaerobic digesters, despite the fact that it is widespread, not only in anaerobic methanogenic reactors and freshwater environments, but also in marine environments, based upon extensive 16S rRNA gene-cloning analyses. In this study, we isolated an aceticlastic methanogen, designated strain 03d30q(T), from a tidal flat sediment. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and mcrA genes revealed that the isolate belongs to the genus Methanosaeta. Unlike the other known Methanosaeta species, this isolate grows at Na(+) concentrations of 0.20 to 0.80 M, with an optimum concentration of 0.28 M. Quantitative estimation using real-time PCR detected the 16S rRNA gene of the genus Methanosaeta in the marine sediment, and relative abundance ranged from 3.9{\%} to 11.8{\%} of the total archaeal 16S rRNA genes. In addition, the number of Methanosaeta organisms increased with increasing depth and was much higher than that of Methanosarcina organisms, suggesting that aceticlastic methanogens contribute to acetate metabolism to a greater extent than previously thought in marine environments, where sulfate-reducing acetate oxidation prevails. This is the first report on marine Methanosaeta species, and based on phylogenetic and characteristic studies, the name "Methanosaeta pelagica" sp. nov. is proposed for this novel species, with type strain 03d30q.},

abstract = {Syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is an alternative methanogenic pathway in certain thermophilic anaerobic environments such as high-temperature oil reservoirs and thermophilic biogas reactors. In these environments, the dominant thermophilic methanogens were generally related to uncultured organisms of the genus Methanothermobacter. Here we isolated two representative strains, Tm2(T) and HMD, from the oil sands and oil production water in the Shengli oil field in the People's Republic of China. The type strain, Tm2(T), was nonmotile and stained Gram positive. The cells were straight to slightly curved rods (0.3 $\mu$m in width and 2.2 to 5.9 $\mu$m in length), but some of them possessed a coccal shape connecting with the rods at the ends. Strain Tm2(T) grew with H(2)-CO(2), but acetate is required. Optimum growth of strain Tm2(T) occurred in the presence of 0.025 g/liter NaCl at pH 6.9 and a temperature of 65°C. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 40.1 mol{\%} ± 1.3 mol{\%} (by the thermal denaturation method) or 41.1 mol{\%} (by high-performance liquid chromatography). Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that Tm2(T) was most closely related to Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus $\Delta$H(T) and Methanothermobacter wolfeii VKM B-1829(T) (both with a sequence similarity of 96.4{\%}). Based on these phenotypic and phylogenic characteristics, a novel species was proposed and named Methanothermobacter crinale sp. nov. The type strain is Tm2(T) (ACCC 00699(T) = JCM 17393(T)).},

Strain OL-4(T) degraded oleate, a mono-unsaturated fatty acid, and straight-chain fatty acids C(4 : 0)-C(18 : 0) in syntrophic association with Methanobacterium formicicum DSM 1535(NT). Even-numbered fatty acids were degraded to acetate and methane whereas odd-numbered fatty acids were degraded to acetate, propionate and methane. Branched-chain fatty acids were not degraded. The bacterium could not grow axenically with any other substrate tested and therefore is considered to be obligately syntrophic. Fumarate, sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfur and nitrate could not serve as electron acceptors for strain OL-4(T) to degrade oleate or butyrate. Cells of strain OL-4(T) were curved rods, formed spores and showed a variable response to Gram staining. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain OL-4(T) was most closely related to the fatty-acid-oxidizing, syntrophic bacterium Syntrophomonas sp. TB-6 (95 {\%} similarity), Syntrophomonas wolfei subsp. wolfei DSM 2245(T) (94 {\%} similarity) and Syntrophomonas erecta DSM 16215(T) (93 {\%} similarity). In addition to this moderate similarity, phenotypic and physiological characteristics, such as obligate syntrophy, spore formation and utilization of a broader substrate range, differentiated strain OL-4(T) from these Syntrophomonas species. Therefore strain OL-4(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Syntrophomonas zehnderi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is OL-4(T) (=DSM 17840(T)=JCM 13948(T)).},

In order to understand the requirement of trace metals for methanogens, the accurate measurement of trace metals inside cells of methanogens was required. In this study, acclimated-methanogens were cultured in batch feed substrate gas (H2=CO2) at 37◦C. The balance and uptake of trace metals for cell of acclimated- methanogens were investigated by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) and scanning probe microscopy. Cells of the acclimated-methanogens were harvested in the early stationary growth phases and separated by centrifugation and 8ltration using cellulose membrane under anaerobic condition. In order to remove trace metal ions on the surface of the cells, it was washed with di9erent liquids-distilled water, physiological salt solution, phosphate bu9er and EDTA mixture liquid, in di9erent experiments. By using scanning probe microscopy, we found that cell lysis occurred and thus transitional trace metals severely lost when cells were washed with distilled water, while the minimum washing which e9ect cell lysis was obtained by using phosphate bu9er. Washed cells were broken by wet digestion method and analyzed for the content of trace metals by using ICP-MS. The major elements contained in the methanogens cell were obtained, and it was clear that, for conventional method, the shortage of Fe will be created when methanogens grew up to about 1:32 g l−1, and Zn, Cu, Ni and Co contents will be lacked when methanogens grow up to 1.13, 0.12, 4.8 and 30 g l−1, respectively. In conclusion, to achieve a high productivity of methane fermentation, Fe, Cu, Ni and Zn contents in the fermentation liquid should be greatly increased.},

abstract = {Wastewater coming from cheese-producing industries in Greece is high in organic matter (about 40-60 g/l Chemical Oxygen Demand, COD) since it generally contains discarded cheese-whey as well. This wastewater is rich in easily biodegradable carbohydrates and has a relatively low content in suspended solids (1-5 g/l). Because of the high organic content of dairy wastewater, anaerobic digestion is essentially the only viable treatment method. An Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactor is a high rate treatment system, especially feasible for treating soluble (containing low solids) wastewaters. A well-performing UASB reactor is characterized by highly flocculated, well-settling, compact methanogenic sludge granules, resulting in a very high biomass content. The aim of this work is the study of a UASB reactor treating dairy wastewater. A UASB reactor of 10 l useful volume was constructed and inoculated with anaerobic mixed liquor from dairy wastewater and glucose fed digesters. The digester efficiency of treating dairy wastewater at various organic loading rates was studied and its performance was assessed by monitoring pH, dissolved chemical oxygen demand (COD), biogas production and composition. Operation at an organic loading rate of 6{\textperiodcentered}2 g COD/l d was found to be safe and could be increased to a maximum of 7{\textperiodcentered}5 g COD/l d . A draw and fill digester fed with non-diluted wastewater was also studied in parallel for comparison purposes. The advantages of using a UASB reactor versus a conventional digester become questionable for the high COD ({\textgreater}42 g/l), non-diluted dairy wastewater case.},

abstract = {Seven low-cost digesters in Costa Rica were studied to determine the potential of these systems to treat animal wastewater and produce renewable energy. The effluent water has a significantly lower oxygen demand (COD decreased from 2968 mg/L to 472 mg/L) and higher dissolved nutrient concentration (NH4-N increased by 78.3{\%} to 82.2 mg/L) than the influent water, which increases the usefulness of the effluent as an organic fertilizer and decreases its organic loading on surface waters. On average, methane constituted 66{\%} of the produced biogas, which is consistent with industrial digesters. Through principle component analysis, COD, turbidity, NH4-N, TKN, and pH were determined to be the most useful parameters to characterize wastewater. The results suggest that the systems have the ability to withstand fluctuations in the influent water quality. This study revealed that small-scale agricultural digesters can produce methane at concentrations useful for cooking, while improving the quality of the livestock wastewater.},

abstract = {Since compost is widely used as soil amendment and the fact that during the processing of compost material high amounts of microorganisms are released into the air, we investigated whether compost may act as a carrier for thermophilic methanogens to temperate soils. All eight investigated compost materials showed a clear methane production potential between 0.01 and 0.98 micromol CH(4) g dw(-1)h(-1) at 50 degrees C. Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and cloning analysis indicated the presence of Methanosarcina thermophila, Methanoculleus thermophilus, and Methanobacterium formicicum. Bioaerosols collected during the turning of a compost pile showed both a highly similar SSCP profile compared to the corresponding compost material and clear methane production during anoxic incubation in selective medium at 50 degrees C. Both observations indicated a considerable release of thermophilic methanogens into the air. To analyse the persistence of compost-borne thermophilic methanogens in temperate oxic soils, we therefore studied their potential activity in compost and compost/soil mixtures, which was brought to a meadow soil, as well as in an agricultural soil fertilised with compost. After 24h anoxic incubation at 50 degrees C, all samples containing compost showed a clear methanogenic activity, even 1 year after application. In combination with the in vitro observed resilience of the compost-borne methanogens against desiccation and UV radiation we assume that compost material acts as an effective carrier for the distribution of thermophilic methanogens by fertilisation and wind.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the exploitation of cheese whey as a source for hydrogen and methane, in a two-stage continuous process. Mesophilic fermentative hydrogen production from undiluted cheese whey was investigated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 h. Alkalinity addition (NaHCO(3)) or an automatic pH controller were used, to maintain the pH culture at a constant value of 5.2. The hydrogen production rate was 2.9+/-0.2 L/Lreactor/d, while the yield of hydrogen produced was approximately 0.78+/-0.05 mol H(2)/mol glucose consumed, with alkalinity addition, while the respective values when using pH control were 1.9+/-0.1 L/Lreactor/d and 0.61+/-0.04 mol H(2)/mol glucose consumed. The corresponding yields of hydrogen produced were 2.9 L of H(2)/L cheese whey and 1.9 L of H(2)/L cheese whey, respectively. The effluent from the hydrogenogenic reactor was further digested to biogas in a continuous mesophilic anaerobic bioreactor. The anaerobic digester was operated at an HRT of 20 d and produced approximately 1L CH(4)/d, corresponding to a yield of 6.7 L CH(4)/L of influent. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) elimination reached 95.3{\%} demonstrating that cheese whey could be efficiently used for hydrogen and methane production, in a two-stage process.},

A noteworthy characteristic was its inability to grow on normal agar plates and in roll tubes. The cells were coccus shaped and non-motile, with an extracellular slime layer. Growth of strain CelloT occurred between 20 and 40 °C, with optimal growth at 37 °C. The pH range for growth was 5–7?5 with an optimum at 6?5. In pure culture, strain CelloT could only grow on a variety of sugars. Glucose was converted to acetate, ethanol and H2. The doubling time on glucose was 0?5 h. In a syntrophic co-culture with Methanospirillum hungatei strain JF-1T, strain CelloT converted glucose to acetate and H2. The G+Ccontent was 59?2 mol{\%}. 16S rDNA analysis revealed that the closest relatives of strain CelloT were two uncultured bacteria from anaerobic digesters, both with 94{\%} 16S rDNA sequence similarity. The closest cultured representatives belong to genera of the bacterial division ‘Verrucomicrobia'.

Limitation of the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) on methanol due to the absence of zinc from the influent developed after 137 days of operation. At that day, the SMA in medium with a complete trace metal solution except Zn was 3.4 g CH4-COD g VSS−1 day−1, compared to 4.2 g CH4-COD g VSS−1 day−1 in a medium with a complete (including zinc) trace metal solution. The methanol removal capacity during these 137 days was 99{\%} and no volatile fatty acids accumulated. Two UASB reactors, inoculated with the zinc-deprived sludge, were operated to study restoration of the zinc limitation by zinc supplementation to the bioreactor influent. In a first reactor, no changes to the operational conditions were made. This resulted in methanol accumulation in the reactor effluent after 12 days of operation, which subsequently induced acetogenic activity 5 days after the methanol accumulation started. Methanogenesis could not be recovered by the continuous addition of 0.5 $\mu$M ZnCl2 to the reactor for 13 days. In the second reactor, 0.5 $\mu$M ZnCl2 was added from its start-up. Although the reactor stayed 10 days longer methanogenically than the reactor operated without zinc, methanol accumulation was observed in this reactor (up to 1.1 g COD-MeOH L−1) as well. This study shows that zinc limitation can induce failure of methanol fed UASB reactors due to acidification, which cannot be restored by resuming the continuous supply of the deprived metal.},

The use of PCR primers to amplify intervening sequences of DNA between specific repetitive elements in Bacteria has become a standard method for rapidly genotyping bacterial strains and providing good resolution between multiple strains within a single species. Rapid, standardized methods for high resolution genotyping of Archaea are not widely available. We evaluated the DiversiLab system from Bacterial Barcodes that utilizes a kit-based repetitive sequence-based (rep-PCR) method that has been optimized for genotyping DNA was extracted from the source organisms using either a standard chemical DNA extraction kit or Whatman FTA paper. Rep-PCR was performed using an archaeal primer set and, the products were run on an Agilent, Lab-on-a-Chip DNA analyzer. Results were analyzed and compared using DiversiLab web-based software from Bacterial Barcodes. Seventy-nine strains representing 27 genera of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were analyzed. All the organisms could be successfully genotyped and the results were reproducible. We could not detect differences in rep-PCR profiles between DNA extracted using the chemical extraction kit and FTA paper. Thus far, 14 genera and 32 species of methanogens have been analyzed, and all yielded unique genotypes. For halophiles, 11 genera and 28 different species were analyzed, and all yielded unique genotypes. A comparison of 7 different strains of Halobacterium salinarium demonstrated that 6 of the 7 strains had a unique genotype. A comparison of 4 strains of Methanosarcina mazei indicated that each strain produced a unique genotype. There was little systematic inference that could be made from dendrograms comparing different strains, species, and genera of Archaea based on UPGMA cluster analysis. Based on these results, rep-PCR was a useful tool for the genotyping and strain identification of Archaea.},

Three different sets of primers coupled with a TaqMan probe for QPCR assays to detect the 16S rRNA genes of the order Methanosarcinales, as well as the families Methanosarcinaceae and Methanosaetaceae, were separately used. Using these primer and probe sets, the 16S rRNA genes of aceticlastic methanogens in samples from various anaerobic processes (i.e., nine pure cultures, batch experiment, and three different continuous processes including a full-scale digester), were monitored and quantified by QPCR assays. A batch experiment cultivating a mixture of aceticlastic methanogens, was conducted to monitor their population dynamics. Using this group-specific quantification method, the dynamics of a competition between two aceticlastic populations, as modulated by the acetate concentration, could well be described. The target 16S rRNA genes in environmental samples, collected from three different anaerobic processes treating sludge, cheese whey, and synthetic wastewaters, were additionally quantified. The quantified 16S rRNA gene concentrations for all samples successfully represented the community structures of the target methanogens, which were correlated accurately with the operational parameters of the anaerobic processes. It was also successful to demonstrate probe nesting of aceticlastic methanogens at the levels of order and family.},

abstract = {Seven low-cost digesters in Costa Rica were studied to determine the potential of these systems to treat animal wastewater and produce renewable energy.

abstract = {An anaerobic mesophilic digestor was operated using beef cattle waste (diluted to 5.75{\%} volatile solids) as substrate; retention time was 10 days with daily batch feed. Volatile solids destruction was 36{\%}. Daily gas production rate was 1.8 liters of gas (standard temperature and pressure) per liter of digestor contents (0.99 liters of CH4 per liter of digestor contents). Acetate turnover was measured, and it was calculated that 68{\%} of the CH4 was derived from the methyl group of acetate. When the methanogenic substrates acetic acid or H2/CO2 were added to the digestor on a continuous basis, the microflora were able to adapt and convert them to terminal products while continuing to degrade animal waste to the same extent as without additions. The methanogenic substrates were added at a rate at least 1.5 times the microbial production rate which was measured in the absence of added substrates. Added acetate was converted directly to CH4 by acetoclastic methanogens; H2 addition greatly stimulated acetate production in the digestor. A method is described for the measurement of acetate turnover in batch-fed digestors.},

abstract = {It is well established that waste activated sludge with an extended sludge age is inherently slow to degrade with a low extent of degradation. Pre-treatment methods can be used prior to anaerobic digestion to improve the efficiency of activated sludge digestion. Among these pre-treatment methods, temperature phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD) is one promising method with a relatively low energy input and capital cost. In this study, an experimental thermophilic (50-70 °C)-mesophilic system was compared against a control mesophilic-mesophilic system. The thermophilic-mesophilic system achieved 41{\%} and 48{\%} volatile solids (VS) destruction during pre-treatment of 60 °C and 65 °C (or 70 °C) respectively, compared to 37{\%} in the mesophilic-mesophilic TPAD system. Solubilisation in the first stage was enhanced during thermophilic pre-treatment (15{\%} at 50 °C and 27{\%} at 60 °C, 65 °C and 70 °C) over mesophilic pre-treatment (7{\%}) according to a COD balance. This was supported by ammonia-nitrogen measurements. Model based analysis indicated that the mechanism for increased performance was due to an increase in hydrolysis coefficient under thermophilic pre-treatment of 60 °C (0.5 ± 0.1 d-1), 65 °C (0.7 ± 0.2 d-1) and 70 °C (0.8 ± 0.2 d-1) over mesophilic pre-treatment (0.2 ± 0.1 d-1), and thermophilic pre-treatment at 50 °C (0.12 ± 0.06 d-1).},

abstract = {Trace metals play an important role in the growth of methanogens and methane formation. In order to understand the requirement of trace metals for methanogens, the accurate measurement of trace metals inside cells of methanogens was required. In this study, acclimated-methanogens were cultured in batch feed substrate gas (H2=CO2) at 37◦C. The balance and uptake of trace metals for cell of acclimated- methanogens were investigated by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) and scanning probe microscopy. Cells of the acclimated-methanogens were harvested in the early stationary growth phases and separated by centrifugation and 8ltration using cellulose membrane under anaerobic condition. In order to remove trace metal ions on the surface of the cells, it was washed with di9erent liquids-distilled water, physiological salt solution, phosphate bu9er and EDTA mixture liquid, in di9erent experiments. By using scanning probe microscopy, we found that cell lysis occurred and thus transitional trace metals severely lost when cells were washed with distilled water, while the minimum washing which e9ect cell lysis was obtained by using phosphate bu9er. Washed cells were broken by wet digestion method and analyzed for the content of trace metals by using ICP-MS. The major elements contained in the methanogens cell were obtained, and it was clear that, for conventional method, the shortage of Fe will be created when methanogens grew up to about 1:32 g l−1, and Zn, Cu, Ni and Co contents will be lacked when methanogens grow up to 1.13, 0.12, 4.8 and 30 g l−1, respectively. In conclusion, to achieve a high productivity of methane fermentation, Fe, Cu, Ni and Zn contents in the fermentation liquid should be greatly increased.},

Butyrate was {\{}beta{\}}-oxidized to acetate with protons as the electron acceptors. Acetate was used concurrently with its production in the triculture. We found a higher butyrate degradation rate in the triculture, in which both hydrogen and acetate were utilized, than in the coculture, in which acetate accumulated. Yeast extract, rumen fluid, and clarified digestor fluid stimulated butyrate degradation, while the effect of Trypticase was less pronounced. Penicillin G, D-cycloserine, and vancomycin caused complete inhibition of butyrate utilization by the cultures. No growth or degradation of butyrate occurred when 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid or chloroform, specific inhibitors of methanogenic bacteria, was added to the cultures and common electron acceptors such as sulfate, nitrate, and fumarate were not used with butyrate as the electron donor. Addition of hydrogen or oxygen to the gas phase immediately stopped growth and butyrate degradation by the cultures. Butyrate was, however, metabolized at approximately the same rate when hydrogen was removed from the cultures and was metabolized at a reduced rate in the cultures previously exposed to hydrogen.},

Although the high amounts of K and P were beneficial, there were some high concentrations of Na in biogas residues and pig manures. Intense additions of Cu, Zn, and Se are reflected in high loads in the respective excrements, and these amounts in some instances exceeded the threshold limits for soil contamination. Selenium addition to arable soils can be regarded as beneficial, however, as Austria is a low Se area. Composts and sewage sludges were higher in Al and lithophilic trace elements than were the excrements. Factor analysis traced phosphates as the main source of Cd. Cr in processed matrices was significantly higher, and abrasion from tools should be considered in future investigations. Other unwanted trace elements, like Ni, Pb, As and Hg, were found at a rather low concentration.},

One UASB was operated without sulphate addition (control reactor-R1) whereas the second was fed with sulphate at a COD:SO4(2-) ratio of 10 (sulphate-fed reactor-R2), providing an influent sulphate concentration of 0.6 g l(-1). For both reactors, methanogenesis was the dominant process with no considerable accumulation of acetate. The methanol removal averaged 93{\%} and 83{\%} for R1 and R2, respectively, and total sulphate removal was achieved in the latter. The pathway of methanol conversion for both sludges was investigated by measuring the fate of carbon in the presence and absence of bicarbonate or specific inhibitors for a sludge sample collected at day 72. In both sludges, about 70{\%} of the methanol was syntrophically converted to methane and/or sulphide, via the intermediate H2/CO2. A strong competition between methanogens and sulphidogens took place in the R2 sludge with half of the methanol-COD being used by methane-producing bacteria and the other half by sulphate-reducing bacteria. Acetate was not an important intermediate for both sludges, and played a slightly more important role for the sulphate-adapted sludge (R2), sustained by the higher amount of bicarbonate produced during sulphate-reduction. The pathway study indicates that, although acetate does not represent an important intermediate, the system is susceptible to its accumulation.},

abstract = {Since compost is widely used as soil amendment and the fact that during the processing of compost material high amounts of microorganisms are released into the air, we investigated whether compost may act as a carrier for thermophilic methanogens to temperate soils. All eight investigated compost materials showed a clear methane production potential between 0.01 and 0.98 micromol CH(4) g dw(-1)h(-1) at 50 degrees C. Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and cloning analysis indicated the presence of Methanosarcina thermophila, Methanoculleus thermophilus, and Methanobacterium formicicum. Bioaerosols collected during the turning of a compost pile showed both a highly similar SSCP profile compared to the corresponding compost material and clear methane production during anoxic incubation in selective medium at 50 degrees C. Both observations indicated a considerable release of thermophilic methanogens into the air. To analyse the persistence of compost-borne thermophilic methanogens in temperate oxic soils, we therefore studied their potential activity in compost and compost/soil mixtures, which was brought to a meadow soil, as well as in an agricultural soil fertilised with compost. After 24h anoxic incubation at 50 degrees C, all samples containing compost showed a clear methanogenic activity, even 1 year after application. In combination with the in vitro observed resilience of the compost-borne methanogens against desiccation and UV radiation we assume that compost material acts as an effective carrier for the distribution of thermophilic methanogens by fertilisation and wind.},

In this paper, sequences of 115 proteins from M. jannaschii are compared with their homologs from mesophilic Methanococcus species. Although the growth temperatures of the mesophiles are about 50 degrees C below that of M. jannaschii, their genomic G+C contents are nearly identical. The properties most correlated with the proteins of the thermophile include higher residue volume, higher residue hydrophobicity, more charged amino acids (especially Glu, Arg, and Lys), and fewer uncharged polar residues (Ser, Thr, Asn, and Gln). These are recurring themes, with all trends applying to 83-92{\%} of the proteins for which complete sequences were available. Nearly all of the amino acid replacements most significantly correlated with the temperature change are the same relatively conservative changes observed in all proteins, but in the case of the mesophile/thermophile comparison there is a directional bias. We identify 26 specific pairs of amino acids with a statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.01) preferred direction of replacement.},

The gut microbiota comprises protists (single-celled eukaryotes), bacteria, and archaea, most of which are unique to the termite gut ecosystem. Although this symbiosis has long been intriguing researchers of both basic and applied sciences, its detailed mechanism remains unclear due to the enormous complexity and the unculturability of the microbiota. In the effort to overcome the difficulty, recent advances in omics, such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics have gradually unveiled the black box of this symbiotic system. Genomics targeting a single species of the unculturable microbial members has also provided a great progress in the understanding of the symbiotic interrelationships among the gut microorganisms. In this review, the symbiotic system organized by wood-feeding termites and their gut microorganisms is outlined, focusing on the recent achievement in omics studies of this multilayered symbiotic system.},

When the chromatogram was sprayed with the indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70{\%} ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. Succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. In addition, these organic acids showed different Rf values. The total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. The proposed TLC method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five Bifidobacterium species. (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (Lactobacillus casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and S. lactis). Both spots of lactic acid and acetic acid were detected on all the TLC plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. The five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. Accordingly, the proposed TLC method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of Bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.},

abstract = {This study investigates the oxidation of labeled methane (CH(4)) and the CH(4) dependence of sulfate reduction in three types of anaerobic granular sludge. In all samples, (13)C-labeled CH(4) was anaerobically oxidized to (13)C-labeled CO(2), while net endogenous CH(4) production was observed. Labeled-CH(4) oxidation rates followed CH(4) production rates, and the presence of sulfate hampered both labeled-CH(4) oxidation and methanogenesis. Labeled-CH(4) oxidation was therefore linked to methanogenesis. This process is referred to as trace CH(4) oxidation and has been demonstrated in methanogenic pure cultures. This study shows that the ratio between labeled-CH(4) oxidation and methanogenesis is positively affected by the CH(4) partial pressure and that this ratio is in methanogenic granular sludge more than 40 times higher than that in pure cultures of methanogens. The CH(4) partial pressure also positively affected sulfate reduction and negatively affected methanogenesis: a repression of methanogenesis at elevated CH(4) partial pressures confers an advantage to sulfate reducers that compete with methanogens for common substrates, formed from endogenous material. The oxidation of labeled CH(4) and the CH(4) dependence of sulfate reduction are thus not necessarily evidence of anaerobic oxidation of CH(4) coupled to sulfate reduction.},

abstract = {This paper describes rapid techniques to evaluate the methane potential and biomass yield of solid wastes. A number of solid wastes were mixed to provide a range of C:N ratios. Empirical formulae were calculated for each waste based on the results of chemical analysis and these formulae were used to estimate the COD equivalent and stoichiometric methane potential (SMP). The actual COD and biochemical methane potential (BMP) were determined experimentally for each waste and for both parameters there was a good agreement between the empirical and experimental values. The potential of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to act as an indicator of biomass yield (mg VSS mg-1 COD removed) was determined during the anaerobic digestion process. The biomass yield determined from ATP analysis was in the range 0.01-0.25 mg VSS mg-1 COD removed which corroborated well with previously reported studies. Empirical formula based SMP together with ATP measurement were shown to provide rapid methods to replace or augment the traditional BMP and VSS measurements and are useful for evaluating the bioenergy and biomass potential of solid wastes for anaerobic digestion.},

The aim of the work was to test and evaluate several recovery actions, such as reactor feeding patterns, dilution and addition of adsorbents, in order to determine the most appropriate strategy for fast recovery of the reactor activity in manure based plants inhibited by LCFA. Dilution with active inoculum for increasing the biomass/LCFA ratio, or addition of adsorbents for adsorbing the LCFA and reducing the bioavailable LCFA concentration, were found to be the best recovery strategies, improving the recovery time from 10 to 2 days, in semi-continuously fed systems. Moreover, acclimatization was introduced by repeated inhibition and process recovery. The subsequent exposure of the anaerobic biomass to an inhibitory concentration of LCFA improved the recovery ability of the system, indicated as increasing degradation rates from 0.04 to 0.16 g COD{\_}CH(4)/g VS day. The incubation time between subsequent pulses, or discontinuous LCFA pulses, seems to be a decisive process parameter to tackle LCFA inhibition in manure anaerobic co-digestion.},

abstract = {Methanogenesis, the biological production of methane, plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle and contributes significantly to global warming. The majority of methane in nature is derived from acetate. Here we report the complete genome sequence of an acetate-utilizing methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A. Methanosarcineae are the most metabolically diverse methanogens, thrive in a broad range of environments, and are unique among the Archaea in forming complex multicellular structures. This diversity is reflected in the genome of M. acetivorans. At 5,751,492 base pairs it is by far the largest known archaeal genome. The 4524 open reading frames code for a strikingly wide and unanticipated variety of metabolic and cellular capabilities. The presence of novel methyltransferases indicates the likelihood of undiscovered natural energy sources for methanogenesis, whereas the presence of single-subunit carbon monoxide dehydrogenases raises the possibility of nonmethanogenic growth. Although motility has not been observed in any Methanosarcineae, a flagellin gene cluster and two complete chemotaxis gene clusters were identified.

abstract = {The surfaces of 8 bacterial and 23 archaeal species, including many hyperthermophilic Archaea, could be stained using succinimidyl esters of fluorescent dyes. This allowed us for the first time to analyze the mode of cell wall growth in Archaea by subculturing stained cells. The data obtained show that incorporation of new cell wall material in Archaea follows the pattern observed for Bacteria: in the coccoid species Pyrococcus furiosus incorporation was in the region of septum formation while for the rod-shaped species Methanopyrus kandleri and Methanothermus sociabilis, a diffuse incorporation of cell wall material over the cell length was observed. Cell surface appendages like fimbriae/pili, fibers, or flagella were detectable by fluorescence staining only in a very few cases although their presence was proven by electron microscopy. Our data in addition prove that Alexa Fluor dyes can be used for in situ analyses at temperatures up to 100°C.},

The results of each analysis showed that Methanobacteriales was dominant in the rumen of both groups. By mcrA gene analysis, 22.1{\%} of unfaunated clones were classified into unfaunated group 1, which was not detected from faunated cattle. The 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that the number of operational taxonomic units was higher in unfaunated than faunated cattle, suggesting the diversity of methanogens tended to be higher by the removal of protozoa. The results of the LIBSHUFF program indicated that the 16S rRNA gene and mcrA gene clone libraries for the faunated group differed from those for the unfaunated group (P = 0.001). It was suggested that the presence of protozoa strongly affected the composition of rumen methanogens.},

abstract = {Methanogenesis, the biological production of methane, plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle and contributes significantly to global warming. The majority of methane in nature is derived from acetate. Here we report the complete genome sequence of an acetate-utilizing methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A. Methanosarcineae are the most metabolically diverse methanogens, thrive in a broad range of environments, and are unique among the Archaea in forming complex multicellular structures. This diversity is reflected in the genome of M. acetivorans. At 5,751,492 base pairs it is by far the largest known archaeal genome. The 4524 open reading frames code for a strikingly wide and unanticipated variety of metabolic and cellular capabilities. The presence of novel methyltransferases indicates the likelihood of undiscovered natural energy sources for methanogenesis, whereas the presence of single-subunit carbon monoxide dehydrogenases raises the possibility of nonmethanogenic growth. Although motility has not been observed in any Methanosarcineae, a flagellin gene cluster and two complete chemotaxis gene clusters were identified. The availability of genetic methods, coupled with its physiological and metabolic diversity, makes M. acetivorans a powerful model organism for the study of archaeal biology.

Analysis of the DNA sequences from the conserved regions yielded two degenerate sequences from which a forward primer, a 32-mer, and a reverse primer, a 23-mer, could be derived for use in the specific PCR-based detection of methanogens. The primers were successfully evaluated against 23 species of methanogen representing all five recognized orders of this group of Archaea, generating a PCR product between 464 and 491 bp. Comparisons between the mcrA and 16S small subunit rRNA gene sequences using PHYLIP demonstrated that the tree topologies were strikingly similar. Methods were developed to enable the analysis of methanogen populations in landfill using the mcrA gene as the target. Two landfill sites were examined and 63 clones from a site in Mucking, Essex, and 102 from a site in Odcombe, Somerset, were analysed. Analysis revealed a far greater diversity in the methanogen population within landfill material than has been seen previously.},

The bacterium converted propionate to acetate in co-culture with Methanospirillum hungatei JF-1(T) or Methanobacterium formicicum MF(NT), but not in co-culture with Methanobrevibacter arboriphilus AZ. The organism could not be cultured axenically with any of the substrates tested and therefore can be considered as a (the first) true anaerobic syntrophic bacterium. The bacterium contained two distinct 16S rRNA gene sequences, with 96.8{\%} sequence similarity, which were both expressed during syntrophic growth on propionate as revealed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The most closely related organisms are Cryptanaerobacter phenolicus LR7.2(T), a bacterium that transforms phenol into benzoate, and Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum SI(T), a thermophilic, syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacterium. Other related species belong to the Gram-positive, sulfate-reducing genus Desulfotomaculum. The type strain of Pelotomaculum schinkii is strain HH(T) (=ATCC BAA-615(T)=DSM 15200(T)).},

abstract = {Methanosarcina acetivorans, a strictly anaerobic methane-producing species belonging to the domain Archaea, contains a gene cluster annotated with homologs encoding oxidative stress proteins. One of the genes (MA3736) is annotated as a gene encoding an uncharacterized carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, an enzyme required for aerobic growth with aromatic compounds by species in the domain Bacteria. Methane-producing species are not known to utilize aromatic compounds, suggesting that MA3736 is incorrectly annotated. The product of MA3736, overproduced in Escherichia coli, had protein disulfide reductase activity dependent on a C(67)XXC(70) motif not found in carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase. We propose that MA3736 be renamed mdrA (methanosarcina disulfide reductase). Further, unlike carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, MdrA contained an Fe-S cluster. Binding of the Fe-S cluster was dependent on essential cysteines C(67) and C(70), while cysteines C(39) and C(107) were not required. Loss of the Fe-S cluster resulted in conversion of MdrA from an inactive hexamer to a trimer with protein disulfide reductase activity. The data suggest that MdrA is the prototype of a previously unrecognized protein disulfide reductase family which contains an intermolecular Fe-S cluster that controls oligomerization as a mechanism to regulate protein disulfide reductase activity.},

abstract = {An anaerobic mesophilic digestor was operated using beef cattle waste (diluted to 5.75{\%} volatile solids) as substrate; retention time was 10 days with daily batch feed. Volatile solids destruction was 36{\%}. Daily gas production rate was 1.8 liters of gas (standard temperature and pressure) per liter of digestor contents (0.99 liters of CH4 per liter of digestor contents). Acetate turnover was measured, and it was calculated that 68{\%} of the CH4 was derived from the methyl group of acetate. When the methanogenic substrates acetic acid or H2/CO2 were added to the digestor on a continuous basis, the microflora were able to adapt and convert them to terminal products while continuing to degrade animal waste to the same extent as without additions. The methanogenic substrates were added at a rate at least 1.5 times the microbial production rate which was measured in the absence of added substrates. Added acetate was converted directly to CH4 by acetoclastic methanogens; H2 addition greatly stimulated acetate production in the digestor. A method is described for the measurement of acetate turnover in batch-fed digestors.},

The typical responses include a decrease in performance, accumulation of volatile fatty acids, drop in pH and alkalinity, change in biogas production and composition, and sludge washout.

abstract = {It is well established that waste activated sludge with an extended sludge age is inherently slow to degrade with a low extent of degradation. Pre-treatment methods can be used prior to anaerobic digestion to improve the efficiency of activated sludge digestion. Among these pre-treatment methods, temperature phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD) is one promising method with a relatively low energy input and capital cost. In this study, an experimental thermophilic (50-70 °C)-mesophilic system was compared against a control mesophilic-mesophilic system. The thermophilic-mesophilic system achieved 41{\%} and 48{\%} volatile solids (VS) destruction during pre-treatment of 60 °C and 65 °C (or 70 °C) respectively, compared to 37{\%} in the mesophilic-mesophilic TPAD system. Solubilisation in the first stage was enhanced during thermophilic pre-treatment (15{\%} at 50 °C and 27{\%} at 60 °C, 65 °C and 70 °C) over mesophilic pre-treatment (7{\%}) according to a COD balance. This was supported by ammonia-nitrogen measurements. Model based analysis indicated that the mechanism for increased performance was due to an increase in hydrolysis coefficient under thermophilic pre-treatment of 60 °C (0.5 ± 0.1 d-1), 65 °C (0.7 ± 0.2 d-1) and 70 °C (0.8 ± 0.2 d-1) over mesophilic pre-treatment (0.2 ± 0.1 d-1), and thermophilic pre-treatment at 50 °C (0.12 ± 0.06 d-1).},

abstract = {To date, composting has been regarded as an aerobic process but it has been shown that composting piles are often sources of atmospheric methane. In order to gain a more comprehensive view on the diversity of methanogenic Archaea in compost, gas chromatographical methods and molecular cloning were used to study relationships of thermophilic archaeal communities and changes in methane production potential during compost maturation. According to the thermophilic methane production potential, wide differences could be detected between differently aged compost materials. In material derived from 3- and 4-week-old piles, low and no thermophilic methane production potential, respectively, was observed at 50 degrees C. Material from a 6-week-old pile showed the maximum methane production. With compost maturation, the production slowly decreased again with 6 weeks, 8 weeks, and mature compost showing an optimum methane production potential at 60 degrees C. At 70 degrees C, only 6-week-old material showed a comparable high production of methane. The 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic surveys revealed an increase of archaeal diversity with compost maturation. In the 6-week-old material, 86{\%} of the sequences in the archaeal 16S rRNA library had the highest sequence similarities to Methanothermobacter spp. and the remaining 14{\%} of the clones were related to Methanosarcina thermophila. Quantification of methanogens in 6-week-old material, on the basis of the methane production rate, resulted in values of about 2x10(7) cells per gram fresh weight. In 8-week-old and mature compost material, the proportion of sequences similar to Methanothermobacter spp. decreased to 34{\%} and 0{\%}, respectively. The mature compost material showed the highest variation in identified sequences, although 33{\%} could be assigned to as yet uncultured Archaea (e.g. Rice cluster I, III, and IV). Our results indicate that compost harbours a diverse community of thermophilic methanogens, with changing composition during the maturation process, presumably due to altered pile conditions. Likewise, compost may act as a potential carrier for thermophilic methanogens in temperate soils because it is widely used as a soil amendment.},

abstract = {It is well established that waste activated sludge with an extended sludge age is inherently slow to degrade with a low extent of degradation. Pre-treatment methods can be used prior to anaerobic digestion to improve the efficiency of activated sludge digestion. Among these pre-treatment methods, temperature phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD) is one promising method with a relatively low energy input and capital cost. In this study, an experimental thermophilic (50-70 °C)-mesophilic system was compared against a control mesophilic-mesophilic system. The thermophilic-mesophilic system achieved 41{\%} and 48{\%} volatile solids (VS) destruction during pre-treatment of 60 °C and 65 °C (or 70 °C) respectively, compared to 37{\%} in the mesophilic-mesophilic TPAD system. Solubilisation in the first stage was enhanced during thermophilic pre-treatment (15{\%} at 50 °C and 27{\%} at 60 °C, 65 °C and 70 °C) over mesophilic pre-treatment (7{\%}) according to a COD balance. This was supported by ammonia-nitrogen measurements. Model based analysis indicated that the mechanism for increased performance was due to an increase in hydrolysis coefficient under thermophilic pre-treatment of 60 °C (0.5 ± 0.1 d-1), 65 °C (0.7 ± 0.2 d-1) and 70 °C (0.8 ± 0.2 d-1) over mesophilic pre-treatment (0.2 ± 0.1 d-1), and thermophilic pre-treatment at 50 °C (0.12 ± 0.06 d-1).},

abstract = {The thermochemical pretreatment by saponification of two kinds of fatty slaughterhouse waste--aeroflotation fats and flesh fats from animal carcasses--was studied in order to improve the waste's anaerobic degradation. The effect of an easily biodegradable compound, ethanol, on raw waste biodegradation was also examined. The aims of the study were to enhance the methanisation of fatty waste and also to show a link between biodegradability and bio-availability. The anaerobic digestion of raw waste, saponified waste and waste with a co-substrate was carried out in batch mode under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The results showed little increase in the total volume of biogas, indicating a good biodegradability of the raw wastes. Mean biogas volume reached 1200 mL/g VS which represented more than 90{\%} of the maximal theoretical biogas potential. Raw fatty wastes were slowly biodegraded whereas pretreated wastes showed improved initial reaction kinetics, indicating a better initial bio-availability, particularly for mesophilic runs. The effects observed for raw wastes with ethanol as co-substrate depended on the process temperature: in mesophilic conditions, an initial improvement was observed whereas in thermophilic conditions a significant decrease in biodegradability was observed.},

abstract = {To date, composting has been regarded as an aerobic process but it has been shown that composting piles are often sources of atmospheric methane. In order to gain a more comprehensive view on the diversity of methanogenic Archaea in compost, gas chromatographical methods and molecular cloning were used to study relationships of thermophilic archaeal communities and changes in methane production potential during compost maturation. According to the thermophilic methane production potential, wide differences could be detected between differently aged compost materials. In material derived from 3- and 4-week-old piles, low and no thermophilic methane production potential, respectively, was observed at 50 degrees C. Material from a 6-week-old pile showed the maximum methane production. With compost maturation, the production slowly decreased again with 6 weeks, 8 weeks, and mature compost showing an optimum methane production potential at 60 degrees C.

abstract = {For partial acidogenesis of cheese-whey wastewater, a set of experiments were carried out to produce short-chain volatile fatty acids (VFA) in laboratory-scale continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR). The maximum rate of acetic and butyric acid production associated with simultaneous changes in hydraulic retention time (HRT), pH, and temperature was investigated, in which the degree of acidification of the whey to the short-chain VFAs was less than 20{\%} of the influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration. Response surface methodology was successfully applied to determine the optimum physiological conditions where the maximum rates of acetic and butyric acid production occurred. These were 0.40-day HRT, pH 6.0 at 54.1°C and 0.22-day HRT, pH 6.5 at 51.9°C, respectively. The optimum conditions for acetic acid production were selected for partial acidification of cheese-whey wastewater because of a higher rate in combined productions of acetic and butyric acids than that at optimum conditions for butyric acid production. A thermophilic two-phase process with the partial acidification followed by a methanation step was operated. Performance of the two-phase process was compared to the single-phase anaerobic system. The two-phase process clearly showed a better performance in management of cheese-whey wastewater over the single-phase system. Maximum rate of COD removal and the rate of methane production in the two-phase process were, respectively, 116{\%} and 43{\%} higher than those of the single-phase system.},

Volatile solids destruction was 36{\%}. Daily gas production rate was 1.8 liters of gas (standard temperature and pressure) per liter of digestor contents (0.99 liters of CH4 per liter of digestor contents). Acetate turnover was measured, and it was calculated that 68{\%} of the CH4 was derived from the methyl group of acetate. When the methanogenic substrates acetic acid or H2/CO2 were added to the digestor on a continuous basis, the microflora were able to adapt and convert them to terminal products while continuing to degrade animal waste to the same extent as without additions. The methanogenic substrates were added at a rate at least 1.5 times the microbial production rate which was measured in the absence of added substrates. Added acetate was converted directly to CH4 by acetoclastic methanogens; H2 addition greatly stimulated acetate production in the digestor. A method is described for the measurement of acetate turnover in batch-fed digestors.},

Cells were slightly curved, non-motile rods. Spore formation was not observed. The optimal temperature for growth was around 37 degrees C and optimal pH for growth was 7.0. Strain MPA(T) was able to grow on crotonate or pentenoate plus butyrate in pure culture. In co-culture with the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanospirillum hungatei, strain MPA(T) was able to oxidize straight-chain saturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths of C4-C18. The strain was unable to utilize sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, nitrate, fumarate, iron(III) or DMSO as an electron acceptor. The G+C content of the DNA was 45.0 mol{\%}. Based on comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain MPA(T) was found to be a member of the genus Syntrophomonas and was most closely related to the type strains of Syntrophomonas curvata and Syntrophomonas sapovorans (sequence similarities of 94 {\%}). Genetic and phenotypic characteristics demonstrated that strain MPA(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Syntrophomonas palmitatica sp. nov. is proposed.

The concentration ranges of iron and total sulfide in the experiments were 0.4-5.4 mg Fe L-1 and 0-5.1 mg S L-1, respectively. During anaerobic conditions, iron reduction kinetics were investigated and reduction rates amounted on average to 1.32 mg Fe L-1 d-1. Despite the very low solubility of iron sulfide, the reduced iron reacted only partly with sulfide to produce iron sulfide, even when dissolved sulfide was in excess. When a ferric chloride solution was added to sulfide containing anaerobic wastewater, the ferric iron was quickly reduced to ferrous forms by oxidation of dissolved sulfide and the ferrous iron precipitated almost completely as iron sulfide. During aerobic conditions, iron sulfide was oxidized with a half-life period of 11.7 h. The oxidation rate of iron sulfide was significantly lower than that reported for the oxidation of dissolved sulfide.},

abstract = {A new anaerobic, thermophilic, syntrophic, fatty-acid-oxidizing bacterium designated strain TGB-C1T was isolated from granular sludge in a thermophilic upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. The cells were slightly curved rods and were weakly motile. Spore formation was not observed. The optimal temperature for growth was around 55 degrees C and growth occurred in the range 45 to 60 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 5.8-7.5, and the optimum pH was 6.5-7.0. Crotonate was the only substrate that allowed the strain to grow in pure culture. However, in co-culture with the thermophilic, hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum strain delta H, the isolate could syntrophically oxidize saturated fatty acids with 4-10 carbon atoms, including isobutyrate. During the degradation of isobutyrate by the co-culture, isobutyrate was isomerized to butyrate, which was then oxidized. The strain was not able to utilize sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, nitrate, fumarate or Fe(III) as electron acceptor. The DNA base composition was 51.0 mol{\%}. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that the strain belongs to the family Syntrophomonadaceae, but it was only distantly related to other known species of beta-oxidizing syntrophs. Hence, the name Syntrophothermus lipocalidus is proposed for TGB-C1T as a new species of a new genus. },

abstract = {In the anaerobic treatment of sulfate-containing wastewater, sulfate reduction interferes with methanogenesis. Both mutualistic and competitive interactions between sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogenic bacteria have been observed. Sulfate reducers will compete with methanogens for the common substrates hydrogen, formate and acetate. In general, sulfate reducers have better growth kinetic properties than methanogens, but additional factors which may be of importance in the competition are adherence properties, mixed substrate utilization, affinity for sulfate of sulfate reducers, relative numbers of bacteria, and reactor conditions such as pH, temperature and sulfide concentration. Sulfate reducers also compete with syntrophic methanogenic consortia involved in the degradation of substrates like propionate and butyrate. In the absence of sulfate these methanogenic consortia are very important, but in the presence of sulfate they are thought to be easily outcompeted by sulfate reducers. However, at relatively low sulfate concentrations, syntrophic degradation of propionate and butyrate coupled to HZ removal via sulfate reduction rather than via methanogenesis may become important. A remarkable feature of some sulfate reducers is their ability to grow fermentatively or to grow in syntrophic association with methanogens in the absence of sulfate.},

abstract = {For more complete characterization of DNA-predicted proteins (including their posttranslational modifications) a "top-down" approach using high-resolution tandem MS is forwarded here by its application to methanogens in both hypothesis-driven and discovery modes, with the latter dependent on new automation benchmarks for intact proteins. With proteins isolated from ribosomes and whole-cell lysates of Methanococcus jannaschii (approximately 1,800 genes) using a 2D protein fractionation method, 72 gene products were identified and characterized with 100{\%} sequence coverage via automated fragmentation of intact protein ions in a custom quadrupole/Fourier transform hybrid mass spectrometer. Three incorrect start sites and two modifications were found, with one of each determined for MJ0556, a 20-kDa protein with an unknown methylation at approximately 50{\%} occupancy in stationary phase cells. The separation approach combined with the quadrupole/Fourier transform hybrid mass spectrometer allowed targeted and efficient comparison of histones from M. jannaschii, Methanosarcina acetivorans (largest Archaeal genome, 5.8 Mb), and yeast. This finding revealed a striking difference in the posttranslational regulation of DNA packaging in Eukarya vs. the Archaea. This study illustrates a significant evolutionary step for the MS tools available for characterization of WT proteins from complex proteomes without proteolysis.},

Fluorescent oligonucleotide probes were designed to bind to the symbiont rRNA sequences and to provide direct visual evidence of their origins from methanogenic archaea contained within the host cells. Confocal microscopy was used to analyze the morphology of the endosymbionts in whole cells of Metopus palaeformis, Metopus contortus, Trimyema sp, and Cyclidium porcatum. The endosymbionts are taxonomically diverse and are drawn from three different genera; Methanobacterium, Methanocorpusculum and Methanoplanus. In every case the symbionts are closely related to, but different from, free-living methanogens for which sequences are available. It is thus apparent that symbioses have been formed repeatedly and independently. Ciliates which are unrelated to each other (Trimyema sp. and Metopus contortus) may contain symbionts which are closely related, and congeneric ciliates (Metopus palaeformis and M. contortus) may contain symbionts which are distantly related to each other. This suggests that some of the symbiotic associations must be relatively recent. For example, at least one of the symbioses in Metopus must postdate the speciation of M. palaeformis and M. contortus. Despite this, Metopus contortus, Trimyema sp., Cyclidium porcatum and their respective endosymbionts show sophisticated morphological interactions which probably facilitate the exchange of materials between the partners.},

abstract = {A method based on sequence-specific cleavage of rRNA with ribonuclease H was used to detect almost all known cultivable methanogens in anaerobic biological treatment systems. To do so, a total of 40 scissor probes in different phylogeny specificities were designed or modified from previous studies, optimized for their specificities under digestion conditions with 32 methanogenic reference strains, and then applied to detect methanogens in sludge samples taken from 6 different anaerobic treatment processes. Among these processes, known aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic groups of methanogens from the families Methanosarcinaceae, Methanosaetaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanothermaceae and Methanocaldococcaceae could be successfully detected and identified down to the genus level. Within the aceticlastic methanogens, the abundances of mesophilic Methanosaeta accounted for 5.7-48.5{\%} of the total archaeal populations in mesophilic anaerobic processes, and those of Methanosarcina represented 41.7{\%} of the total archaeal populations in thermophilic processes. For hydrogenotrophic methanogens, members of the Methanomicrobiales, Methanobrevibacter and Methanobacterium were detected in mesophilic processes (1.2-17.2{\%}), whereas those of Methanothermobacter, Methanothermaceae and Methanocaldococcaceae were detected in thermophilic process (2.0-4.8{\%}). Overall results suggested that those hierarchical scissor probes developed could be effective for rapid and possibly on-site monitoring of targeted methanogens in different microbial environments.},

abstract = {An alternative flowchart for the biological removal of hydrogen sulfide from oil-refining wastewater is presented; autotrophic denitrification in a multi-stage treatment plant was utilized. A pilot-scale plant was fed with a mixture of the following constituents: (a) original wastewater from an oil refining industry (b), the effluent of the existing nitrification-stage treatment plant and (c) sulfide in the form of Na2S. Anoxic sulfide to sulfate oxidation, with nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor, proved very successful, as incoming concentrations of 110 mg S2-/L were totally converted to SO42-. At complete denitrification, the concentration of S2- in the reactor effluent was less than 0.1 mg/L. Fluctuating S2- concentration in the feed could be tolerated without any problems, as the accumulated sulfide in the effluent of the denitrification stage is oxidized aerobically in a subsequent activated-sludge treatment stage. This alternative new treatment scheme was further introduced at the refinery's wastewater processing plant. Thus, complete H2S removal is now accomplished by the combination of the proposed biological method and the existing stripping with CO2. As a result, stripping, and thus its cost, is reduced by 70{\%}.},

Introduction of a low airflow (0.7-0.9 m3 m-3 d-1, corresponding to an O2/S molar ratio of 8-10) to a fluidized bed reactor fed with low-sulfate vinasse was sufficient to reduce the biogas H2S-content to an undetectable level. Sulfide was initially oxidized to elemental sulfur, thiosulfate and - most probably - polysulfide. Significant sulfate production did not occur. Bioreactor sludge sampled from the reactor after three weeks' micro-aerobic operation was much faster in oxidizing sulfur than bioreactor sludge sampled during fully anaerobic reactor operation. The reaction proceeded faster with increasing O2/sulfide ratios.},

abstract = {Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus, a thermophilic methanogenic archaeon, produces and accumulates beta-glutamate and L-alpha-glutamate as osmolytes when grown in media with {\textless}1 M NaCl. When the organism is adapted to grow in {\textgreater}1 M NaCl, a new zwitterionic solute, N(epsilon)-acetyl-beta-lysine, is synthesized and becomes the dominant osmolyte. Several techniques, including in vivo and in vitro NMR spectroscopy, HPLC analyses of ethanol extracts, and potassium atomic absorption, have been used to monitor the immediate response of M. thermolithotrophicus to osmotic stress. There is a temporal hierarchy in the response of intracellular osmolytes. Changes in intracellular K(+) occur within the first few minutes of altering the external NaCl. Upon hypoosmotic shock, K(+) is released from the cell; relatively small changes occur in the organic osmolyte pool on a longer time scale. Upon hyperosmotic shock, M. thermolithotrophicus immediately internalizes K(+), far more than would be needed stoichiometrically to balance the new salt concentration. This is followed by a decrease to a new K(+) concentration (over 10-15 min), at which point synthesis and accumulation of primarily L-alpha-glutamate occur. Once growth of the M. thermolithotrophicus culture begins, typically 30-100 min after the hyperosmotic shock, the intracellular levels of organic anions decrease and the zwitterion (N(epsilon)-acetyl-beta-lysine) begins to represent a larger fraction of the intracellular pool. The observation that N(epsilon)-acetyl-beta-lysine accumulation occurs in osmoadapted cells but not immediately after osmotic shock is consistent with the hypothesis that lysine 2,3-aminomutase, an enzyme involved in N(epsilon)-acetyl-beta-lysine synthesis, is either not present at high levels or has low activity in cells grown and adapted to lower NaCl. That lysine aminomutase specific activity is 8-fold lower in protein extracts from cells adapted to low NaCl compared to those adapted to 1.4 M NaCl supports this hypothesis.},

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR techniques were applied to obtain qualitative and quantitative microbial data sets, respectively, based on methanogen 16S rRNA genes. Throughout the operation, dynamic variations in both qualitative and quantitative community structures were observed, with repeated shifts in dominance between the aceticlastic Methanosarcinaceae (suggested mainly by the detection of a Methanosarcina-like population) and the hydrogenotrophic Methanomicrobiales (suggested mainly by the detection of a Methanofollis-like population). This trend corresponded well to the diauxic utilization of acetate and longer-chain fatty acids (C(3)-C(6)), mainly propionate. Joint-plot non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analysis demonstrated that the qualitative and quantitative community shifts had significant correlations with the composition of residual organic acids and the methane production rate, respectively. This suggests the potential use of microbial community shift analysis as an indicative tool for diagnosing anaerobic digestion processes. The results suggest that more attention should be directed to quantitative, as well as qualitative, approaches for a better understanding of anaerobic digestion, particularly in terms of biogas production efficiency, under dynamic and transitional conditions.},

abstract = {Archaea are abundant and drive critical microbial processes in the Earth's cold biosphere. Despite this, not enough is known about the molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation and no biochemical studies have been performed on stenopsychrophilic archaea (e.g., Methanogenium frigidum). This study examined the structural and functional properties of cold shock proteins (Csps) from archaea, including biochemical analysis of the Csp from M. frigidum. csp genes are present in most bacteria and some eucarya but absent from most archaeal genome sequences, most notably, those of all archaeal thermophiles and hyperthermophiles. In bacteria, Csps are small, nucleic acid binding proteins involved in a variety of cellular processes, such as transcription. In this study, archaeal Csp function was assessed by examining the ability of csp genes from psychrophilic and mesophilic Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota to complement a cold-sensitive growth defect in Escherichia coli. In addition, an archaeal gene with a cold shock domain (CSD) fold but little sequence identity to Csps was also examined. Genes encoding Csps or a CSD structural analog from three psychrophilic archaea rescued the E. coli growth defect. The three proteins were predicted to have a higher content of solvent-exposed basic residues than the noncomplementing proteins, and the basic residues were located on the nucleic acid binding surface, similar to their arrangement in E. coli CspA. The M. frigidum Csp was purified and found to be a single-domain protein that folds by a reversible two-state mechanism and to exhibit a low conformational stability typical of cold-adapted proteins. Moreover, M. frigidum Csp was characterized as binding E. coli single-stranded RNA, consistent with its ability to complement function in E. coli. The studies show that some Csp and CSD fold proteins have retained sufficient similarity throughout evolution in the Archaea to be able to function effectively in the Bacteria and that the function of the archaeal proteins relates to cold adaptation. The initial biochemical analysis of M. frigidum Csp has developed a platform for further characterization and demonstrates the potential for expanding molecular studies of proteins from this important archaeal stenopsychrophile.},

abstract = {Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum is a syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacterium that catalyses the intermediate bottleneck step of the anaerobic-biodegradation process. As it thrives on a very small energy conserved by propionate oxidation under syntrophic association with a methanogen, its catabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms are of biological interest. In this study, we constructed high-density oligonucleotide microarrays for P. thermopropionicum, and used them to analyse global transcriptional responses of this organism to different growth substrates (propionate, ethanol, propanol and lactate) in co-culture with a hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaeon, Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (by reference to fumarate monoculture). We found that a substantial number of genes were upregulated in the syntrophic co-cultures irrespective of growth substrates (including those related to amino-acid and cofactor metabolism), suggesting that these processes were influenced by the syntrophic partner. Expression of the central catabolic pathway (the propionate-oxidizing methylmalonyl-CoA pathway) was found to be substrate-dependent and was largely stimulated when P. thermopropionicum was grown on propionate and lactate. This finding was supported by results of growth tests, revealing that syntrophic propionate oxidation was largely accelerated by supplementation with lactate. These results revealed that P. thermopropionicum has complex regulatory mechanisms that alter its metabolism in response to the syntrophic partner and growth substrates.},

abstract = {Subunit D of multisubunit RNA polymerase from many species of archaea is predicted to bind one to two iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, the function of which is unknown. A survey of encoded subunit D in the genomes of sequenced archaea revealed six distinct groups based on the number of complete or partial [4Fe-4S] cluster motifs within domain 3. Only subunit D from strictly anaerobic archaea, including all members of the Methanosarcinales, are predicted to bind two [4Fe-4S] clusters. We report herein the purification and characterization of Methanosarcina acetivorans subunit D in complex with subunit L. Expression of subunit D and subunit L in Escherichia coli resulted in the purification of a D-L heterodimer with only partial [4Fe-4S] cluster content. Reconstitution in vitro with iron and sulfide revealed that the M. acetivorans D-L heterodimer is capable of binding two redox-active [4Fe-4S] clusters. M. acetivorans subunit D deleted of domain 3 (D$\Delta$D3) was still capable of co-purifying with subunit L but was devoid of [4Fe-4S] clusters. Affinity purification of subunit D or subunit D$\Delta$D3 from M. acetivorans resulted in the co-purification of endogenous subunit L with each tagged subunit D. Overall, these results suggest that domain 3 of subunit D is required for [4Fe-4S] cluster binding, but the [4Fe-4S] clusters and domain 3 are not required for the formation of the D-L heterodimer. However, exposure of two [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing D-L heterodimer to oxygen resulted in loss of the [4Fe-4S] clusters and subsequent protein aggregation, indicating that the [4Fe-4S] clusters influence the stability of the D-L heterodimer and therefore have the potential to regulate the assembly and/or activity of RNA polymerase in an oxidant-dependent manner.},

Electron microscopy of ultrathin sections revealed cell walls characteristic of Gramnegative bacteria; the undulated structure of the outer membrane may pertain to the translocation mechanism. Intracytoplasmic membranes were present. Acetate, higher fatty acids, succinate or fumarate served as electron donors and carbon sources. Strain 5ac10 grew also with lactate, but not with benzoate that was used only by strain 4be13. Strain 5ac10 was able to grow slowly on H2 plus CO2 or formate in the presence of sulfate without additional organic carbon source. The capacity of complete oxidation was shown by stoichiometric measurements with acetate plus sulfate. Both strains contained b- and c-type cytochromes. Desulfoviridin was detected only in strain 5ac10. The two filamentous gliding sulfate reducers are described as new species of a new genus, Desulfonema limicola and Desulfonema magnum.},

abstract = {Granular biomass was temporally sampled from a cold (4-15 degrees C) anaerobic bioreactor, which was inoculated with mesophilic biomass and used to treat industrial wastewater in a long-term (3.4 year) study. Data from 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, quantitative PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses indicated that microbial community structure was dynamic, with shifts in the archaeal and bacterial communities' structures observed following start-up and during temperature decreases from 15 to 9.5 degrees C (phase 1). Specifically, the relative abundance of architecturally important Methanosaeta-like (acetoclastic) methanogens decreased, which was concomitant with granule disintegration and the development of a putatively psychrophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogenic community. Genetic fingerprinting suggested the development of a psychroactive methanogenic community between 4 and 10 degrees C (phase 2), which was dominated by acetogenic bacteria and Methanocorpusculum-like (hydrogenotrophic) methanogens. High levels of Methanosaeta-like acetoclastic methanogens and granular biofilm integrity were maintained during phase 2. Overall, decreasing temperature resulted in distinctly altered microbial community structure during phase 1, and the development of a less dynamic psychroactive methanogenic consortium during phase 2. Moreover, psychrophilic H(2)-oxidizing methanogens emerged as important members of the psychroactive consortia after {\textgreater}1200 days of low-temperature cultivation. The data suggest that prolonged psychrophilic cultivation of mesophilic biomass can establish a well-functioning psychroactive methanogenic consortium, thus highlighting the potential of low-temperature anaerobic digestion technology.},

The batch process was successfully operated with an organic removal efficiency of 35{\%} associated with a 91{\%} decrease in the bacterial 16S rRNA gene concentration. The microbial community structures showed continuous shifts within four bacterial phyla and three archaeal orders. Several bacterial species, such as Fusibacter-related, Clostridium-like, and Syntrophus-like organisms, appeared to be responsible for acidogenesis or syntrophic acid degradation. Both hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogens appear to have been involved in the methanogenesis with the acidogenic products. The quantitative structure of the methanogenic populations varied continuously, with the growth of Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales in series, to result in a Methanomicrobiales-dominant population. The ordination of microbial community structures demonstrated that the quantitative methanogenic structure converged to the seed inoculum while the bacterial and archaeal DGGE band patterns diverged. These results provide an insight into the microbial behavior in the transitional phase (e.g., a start-up period) of anaerobic sludge digestion.},

abstract = {The effects of liquid recirculation on a liquefaction-acidogenic reactor in an anaerobic two-phase digesting system operating with grass-clover silage was studied during 40 days after initiating recirculation of effluent from the methanogenic reactor to the liquefaction-acidogenic reactor. An increase in alkalinity and, thus, an increase in pH from 5.2 to 6.0 occurred in the liquefaction-acidogenic reactor. During the same period, a 10-fold increase (from 0.2 to 1.9 g{\textperiodcentered}l-1{\textperiodcentered}h-1) in the degradation rate of mannitol and an almost 9-fold increase in the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was observed. The estimated number of these bacteria increased by one order of magnitude. The average degradation rate of lactate increased 3-fold, probably as a consequence of the more efficient hydrogen consumption by the hydrogenotrophic methanogens. An observed increase in net mineralization of organic nitrogen compounds was probably the main reason for an enhanced net production of organic acids (from 0.2 to 0.9 g{\textperiodcentered}l-1{\textperiodcentered}d-1). The liquefaction of cellulose and hemicellulose was low from the start of recirculation (3{\%} and 20{\%} reduction, respectively) and did not seem to be affected by the liquid recirculation. This was in accordance with the low number of cellulose degraders (4.0{\textperiodcentered}102 counts{\textperiodcentered}ml-1) observed. The results from this investigation show that the initiation of liquid recirculation in silage-fed two-phase biogas processes will stimulate the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the liquefaction-acidogenic reactor. This will lead to more thermodynamically favourable conditions for acidification reactions which are dependent upon interspecies transfer of reducing equivalents.},

abstract = {The activity of and potential substrates for methane-producing bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria were examined in marsh, estuary, and beach intertidal sediments. Slow rates of methane production were detected in all sediments, although rates of sulfate reduction were 100- to 1,000-fold higher. After sulfate was depleted in sediments, the rates of methane production sharply increased. The addition of methylamine stimulated methanogenesis in the presence of sulfate, and [C]methylamine was rapidly converted to CH(4) and CO(2) in freshly collected marsh sediment. Acetate, hydrogen, or methionine additions did not stimulate methanogenesis. [methyl-C]methionine and [2-C]acetate were converted to CO(2) and not to CH(4) in fresh sediment. No reduction of CO(2) to CH(4) occurred in fresh sediment. Molybdate, an inhibitor of sulfate reduction, inhibited [2-C]acetate metabolism by 98.5{\%}. Fluoracetate, an inhibitor of acetate metabolism, inhibited sulfate reduction by 61{\%}. These results suggest that acetate is a major electron donor for sulfate reduction in marine sediments. In the presence of high concentrations of sulfate, methane may be derived from novel substrates such as methylamine.},

In this study, the practical usefulness of such measurements was evaluated from batch experiments with a commercially available NADH sensor in a bench scale reactor. The sensor was linear in the NADH concentration, robust, almost maintenance free, and hardly sensitive to floc size distribution. Measured fluorescence intensity proved to depend strongly on the concentration of active heterotrophic biomass. The NADH level was supposed to be dependent on the ratio of electron donor/electron acceptor availability inside the cells; however, neither acetate nor ammonium addition was reflected by the measurement signal. A jump wise NADH signal change was observed at complete oxygen or nitrate depletion as also reflected by bends in the redox curve. In the near zero concentration ranges of oxygen and nitrate (0.1-0.5 mg/l) the signal changes only slightly in the opposite direction to the redox trend.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the ratio of propionic to acetic acids as a viable and sensitive indicator for upsets caused by organic overloading in an anaerobic digestion system. An anaerobic bacterial population, adapted to glucose (anaerobically digested cow manure fed daily with glucose for 27 days) was used. Biogas production and composition, pH, volatile fatty acids and the CH4:CO2 ratio were also examined in digesters subjected to a steady, slow organic overload and rapidly overloaded concentrations of glucose. During the process of overload, it was observed that, after raising the feed concentration, the ratio of propionic to acetic acid increased immediately, indicating an overload effect prior to changes being observed in the other parameters examined. Where pH was not controlled, a drop in pH resulted from the accumulation of fatty acids some days after this stage. Instability and processes leading to digestion failure can be seen more clearly by means of the propionic: acetic acid ratio when the anaerobic digestion system is well buffered, but the ratio also indicates bacterial stress in overloaded digesters that are not buffered. It is therefore concluded that variations in propionic: acetic acid ratio provide a reliable indicator for impending failure.},

abstract = {Lignin is the most abundant renewable source of aromatic polymer in nature, and its decomposition is indispensable for carbon recycling. It is chemically recalcitrant to breakdown by most organisms because of the complex, heterogeneous structure. The white-rot fungi produce an array of extracellular oxidative enzymes that synergistically and efficiently degrade lignin. The major groups of ligninolytic enzymes include lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, versatile peroxidases, and laccases. The peroxidases are heme-containing enzymes with catalytic cycles that involve the activation by H2O2 and substrate reduction of compound I and compound II intermediates. Lignin peroxidases have the unique ability to catalyze oxidative cleavage of C-C bonds and ether (C-O-C) bonds in non-phenolic aromatic substrates of high redox potential. Manganese peroxidases oxidize Mn(II) to Mn(III), which facilitates the degradation of phenolic compounds or, in turn, oxidizes a second mediator for the breakdown of non-phenolic compounds. Versatile peroxidases are hybrids of lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase with a bifunctional characteristic. Laccases are multi-copper-containing proteins that catalyze the oxidation of phenolic substrates with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water. This review covers the chemical nature of lignin substrates and focuses on the biochemical properties, molecular structures, reaction mechanisms, and related structures/functions of these enzymes.},

abstract = {The X-ray crystal structure of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Mj-GAPDH) was determined to 1.81 A resolution. The crystal belonged to space group C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 83.4, b = 152.0, c = 118.6 A. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and was refined to a final R factor of 17.1{\%} (R(free) = 19.8{\%}). The final structure included the cofactor NADP(+) at the nucleotide-binding site and featured unoccupied inorganic and substrate phosphate-binding sites. A comparison with GAPDH structures from mesophilic sources suggested that Mj-GAPDH is stabilized by extensive electrostatic interactions between the C-terminal alpha-helices and various distal loop regions, which are likely to contribute to thermal stability. The key phosphate-binding residues in the active site of Mj-GAPDH are conserved in other archaeal GAPDH proteins. These residues undergo a conformational shift in response to occupancy of the inorganic phosphate site.},

In parallel, Archaeal community dynamics were monitored by SSCP analysis of the V3 region of 16S rDNA genes and further characterized by partial sequencing of 16S rDNA genes. At day 1 the inoculum contained at least five distinct Archaeal peaks close to known methanogenic species. The dominant peak was very close to Methanosaeta concilli, the remaining species being members of the Methanobacteriales and Methanomicrobiales. A rapid shift of the Archaeal population was observed during the experiment. At day 21 Methanobacterium formicicum, which was not detected at day 1, became the dominant methanogenic species in the bioreactor and remained so until the end of the experiment.},

abstract = {The diversity of microorganisms active within sedimentary rocks provides important controls on the geochemistry of many subsurface environments. In particular, biodegradation of organic matter in sedimentary rocks contributes to the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and other elements and strongly impacts the recovery and quality of fossil fuel resources. In this study, archaeal diversity was investigated along a salinity gradient spanning 8 to 3,490 mM Cl(-) in a subsurface shale rich in CH(4) derived from biodegradation of sedimentary hydrocarbons. Shale pore waters collected from wells in the main CH(4)-producing zone lacked electron acceptors such as O(2), NO(3)(-), Fe(3+), or SO(4)(2-). Acetate was detected only in high-salinity waters, suggesting that acetoclastic methanogenesis is inhibited at Cl(-) concentrations above approximately 1,000 mM. Most-probable-number series revealed differences in methanogen substrate utilization (acetate, trimethylamine, or H(2)/CO(2)) associated with chlorinity. The greatest methane production in enrichment cultures was observed for incubations with salinity at or close to the native pore water salinity of the inoculum. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of archaeal 16S rRNA genes from seven wells indicated that there were links between archaeal communities and pore water salinity. Archaeal clone libraries constructed from sequences from 16S rRNA genes isolated from two wells revealed phylotypes similar to a halophilic methylotrophic Methanohalophilus species and a hydrogenotrophic Methanoplanus species at high salinity and a single phylotype closely related to Methanocorpusculum bavaricum at low salinity. These results show that several distinct communities of methanogens persist in this subsurface, CH(4)-producing environment and that each community is adapted to particular conditions of salinity and preferential substrate use and each community induces distinct geochemical signatures in shale formation waters.},

The wastewater from Rezende Industrial was collected after it had gone through pretreatment (screening, flotation and equalization). COD, BOD and TSS reductions and the biogas production rate were the parameters considered in analyzing the efficiency of the process. The average production of biogas was 111 day(-1) (STP) for the three experimental runs. COD removal varied from 77{\%} to 91{\%} while BOD removal was 95{\%}. The removal of total suspended solids varied from 81{\%} to 86{\%}. This fact supports optimal efficiency of the proposed three-phase separation system as well as the possibility of applying it to the treatment of industrial effluents.},

The aims of the study were to enhance the methanisation of fatty waste and also to show a link between biodegradability and bio-availability. The anaerobic digestion of raw waste, saponified waste and waste with a co-substrate was carried out in batch mode under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The results showed little increase in the total volume of biogas, indicating a good biodegradability of the raw wastes. Mean biogas volume reached 1200 mL/g VS which represented more than 90{\%} of the maximal theoretical biogas potential. Raw fatty wastes were slowly biodegraded whereas pretreated wastes showed improved initial reaction kinetics, indicating a better initial bio-availability, particularly for mesophilic runs. The effects observed for raw wastes with ethanol as co-substrate depended on the process temperature: in mesophilic conditions, an initial improvement was observed whereas in thermophilic conditions a significant decrease in biodegradability was observed.},

Acetone- and isopropanol-utilizing bacteria slowly ferment these substrates to acetate, which allows Methanosaeta spp. to maintain the acetate concentration at levels below the threshold required for growth of Methanosarcina spp. These enrichments eventually develop dense populations of Methanosaeta spp., which can then be separated from contaminating microorganisms to yield axenic cultures.},

abstract = {Wastewater containing highly concentrated nitrogenous and aromatic compounds, such as aniline, is difficult to degrade and very toxic to microorganisms, especially to nitrifier. In order to remove both carbon and nitrogen from aniline wastewater, recently two biofilm reactors equipped with anaerobic-aerobic cycle and internal recirculation have demonstrated some potential in treating the wastewater. In such system, ammonification, methanogenesis and denitrification reactions occurred simultaneously in one anaerobic reactor, followed by COD removal and nitrification in the aerobic reactor. The effect of recirculation ratio on COD and nitrogen removal using such reactor arrangement was therefore investigated in the present work. The results showed that recirculation had little impact on the overall COD removal or denitrification activity in the anaerobic reactor at any tested ratio, 96-98{\%} of overall COD removal efficiency was achieved with a final effluent COD value below 200mg/L. But nitrification and TN removal were strongly affected by recirculation. The nitrification rate reached a maximum of 0.48 kg N/(m(3)d) at recirculation ratio of 1 and complete nitrification was achieved at the recirculation ratios over 2. TN removal efficiency increased continuously and a sharp reduction of sludge production in the system was observed with increasing recirculation.},

abstract = {Methanogenic Archaea are often encountered in habitats that are not entirely anoxic in space or time. Recent biochemical and genomic studies have revealed the capacity of methanogens to reduce molecular oxygen. O(2) reduction by Methanobrevibacter species was investigated. Cell suspensions incubated in agar tubes under a headspace of H(2)-CO(2) and increasing concentrations of O(2) formed a distinct growth band, which coincided with the oxic-anoxic interface and indicated that the influx of O(2) into the band was balanced by its consumption. However, in batch cultures methanogenesis ceased as soon as traces of O(2) were added. Focusing on Methanobrevibacter cuticularis, a species colonizing the microoxic gut epithelium of termites, a diffusion-limited setup was used that allowed the exposure of dense cell suspensions to controlled O(2) fluxes. Here, Methanobrevibacter cuticularis was capable of simultaneous CH(4) production and O(2) consumption. Low O(2) fluxes (10{\%} of the CH(4) production rate) had virtually no influence on methanogenesis [4.5 micromol CH(4) (mg dry wt)(-1) h(-1)], whereas higher O(2) fluxes (up to 30{\%} of the initial CH(4) production rate) caused a reversible decrease in methanogenesis, which was accompanied by a reversible, partial conversion of coenzyme F(420) to factor F(390). The maximum O(2) reduction rate [4.8 micromol O(2) (mg dry wt)(-1) h(-1)] that could be maintained over extended time periods ({\textgreater}30 min) was similar to the CH(4) production rate under anoxic conditions.},

In parallel, Archaeal community dynamics were monitored by SSCP analysis of the V3 region of 16S rDNA genes and further characterized by partial sequencing of 16S rDNA genes. At day 1 the inoculum contained at least five distinct Archaeal peaks close to known methanogenic species. The dominant peak was very close to Methanosaeta concilli, the remaining species being members of the Methanobacteriales and Methanomicrobiales. A rapid shift of the Archaeal population was observed during the experiment. At day 21 Methanobacterium formicicum, which was not detected at day 1, became the dominant methanogenic species in the bioreactor and remained so until the end of the experiment.},

abstract = {The thermochemical pretreatment by saponification of two kinds of fatty slaughterhouse waste--aeroflotation fats and flesh fats from animal carcasses--was studied in order to improve the waste's anaerobic degradation. The effect of an easily biodegradable compound, ethanol, on raw waste biodegradation was also examined. The aims of the study were to enhance the methanisation of fatty waste and also to show a link between biodegradability and bio-availability. The anaerobic digestion of raw waste, saponified waste and waste with a co-substrate was carried out in batch mode under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The results showed little increase in the total volume of biogas, indicating a good biodegradability of the raw wastes. Mean biogas volume reached 1200 mL/g VS which represented more than 90{\%} of the maximal theoretical biogas potential. Raw fatty wastes were slowly biodegraded whereas pretreated wastes showed improved initial reaction kinetics, indicating a better initial bio-availability, particularly for mesophilic runs. The effects observed for raw wastes with ethanol as co-substrate depended on the process temperature: in mesophilic conditions, an initial improvement was observed whereas in thermophilic conditions a significant decrease in biodegradability was observed.},

The addition of 20 mM MgCl2 to the medium gave, rather than rapid lysis, a gradual formation of phase-dark spherical bodies which in thin section appeared as true protoplasts. In general, the protoplasts were stabilized by divalent but not monovalent cations and, unlike whole cells, were sensitive to lysis by Triton X-100. Electron microscopic examination revealed that protoplast formation was preceded by a general breakdown of the cell wall with an apparent squeezing out of the protoplast through the degraded wall. The growth of cells was greatly increased and not accompanied by detectable lysis in a medium modified by elevating the levels of nickel and ammonium.},

Methanogenic activity was monitored using specific methanogenic activity assays. Reactor performance and microbial community dynamics were each well replicated between Reactor 1 and Reactor 2. Archaeal dynamics, in particular, were associated with reactor operating parameters. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism data suggested dynamic acetoclastic and hydrogenophilic methanogenic populations and were in agreement with temporal specific methanogenic activity data.

abstract = {The phylogeny and taxonomy of the mesophilic methane-producing archaea of the order Methanococcales were examined by DNA relatedness, 16S rRNA sequence analysis, cellular protein patterns, and phenotypic methods. The mesophilic species Methanococcus maripaludis, Methanococcus vannielii, Methanococcus voltaei, and "Methanococcus aeolicus" formed a deep group with 5 to 30{\%} DNA relatedness and 92 to 96{\%} 16S rRNA sequence similarity. Twenty-two additional isolates and Methanococcus deltae were similar to the type strain of either M. voltaei or M. maripaludis. Two isolates, strains A2 and A3, exhibited 37{\%} DNA relatedness and 99.2{\%} 16S rRNA sequence similarity to M. voltaei PS(T) (T = type strain). In the absence of phenotypic differences, these organisms were assigned to M. voltaei. Similarly, four autotrophic isolates, strains C5, C6, C7, and C8, exhibited 54 to 69{\%} DNA relatedness and 99.2{\%} 16S rRNA sequence similarity to M. maripaludis JJT and were assigned to M. Maripaludis. While these isolates were sufficiently genetically diverse to justify classification in novel species, few differences were apparent in the phenotypic properties available for measurement. Thus, the phenotypic properties of these lithotrophic archaea were highly conserved and poor indicators of genetic diversity. Partial sequencing of about 200 bases of both the 16S and 23S rRNAs of the isolates demonstrated allelic diversity within methanococcal species. This allelic diversity did not correlate with diversity measured by DNA relatedness, cellular protein pattern, and other methods. Similarly, antisera to whole cells of the type strains did not cross-react strongly to whole cells of strains that were genetically similar, and serological cross-reactivity was not a useful taxonomic method for methanococci. Lastly, on the basis of the results of 16S rRNA sequence analyses and biochemical data, the ancestor of the mesophilic methanococci may have been an autotrophic thermophile.},

This model is based on the premise that degradable components of such substrates are first hydrolyzed into soluble monomers, which are then fermented to liquid and gaseous end products. The model considered cellulose and hemicellulose as the degradable components of typical biomass-based organic substrates; and volatile fatty acids, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide as the end products. Hydrolysis of the particulate forms of the components is modeled by a surface-limiting rate equation, and the formation of end products is modeled following the guidelines of the anaerobic digestion model (ADM1). The model was calibrated and validated using experimental COD and VFA data from six batch reactors where, cattle manure was tested as a representative biomass-based substrate. The model predictions agreed well with the temporal trend in the experimental data, with overall r2 of 0.85 for COD, 0.82 for acetic acid, 0.72 for butyric acid, and 0.42 for propionic acid.},

Using an approach based on quantitative multidimensional capillary HPLC and quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry, coverage of gene expression approached that currently achievable with transcription microarrays. Comprehensive mass spectrometry-based proteomics and spotted cDNA arrays were used to compare global protein and mRNA levels in a wild-type (S2) and mutant strain (S40) of M. maripaludis. Using linear regression with 652 expression ratios generated by both the proteomic and microarray methods, a product moment correlation coefficient of 0.24 was observed. The correlation improved to 0.61 if only genes showing significant expression changes were included. A novel two-stage method of outlier detection was used for the protein measurements when Dixon's Q-test by itself failed to give satisfactory results. The log(2) transformations of the number of peptides or isotopic peptide pairs associated with each ORF, divided by the predicted molecular weight, were found to have moderately positive correlations with two bioinformatic predictors of gene expression based on codon bias. We detected peptides derived from 939 proteins or 55{\%} of the genome coding capacity. Of these, 60 were overexpressed, and 34 were underexpressed in the mutant. Of the 1722 ORFs encoded in the genome, 1597 or 93{\%} were probed by cDNA arrays. Of these, 50 were more highly expressed, and 45 showed lower expression levels in the mutant relative to the wild type. 15 ORFs were shown to be overexpressed by both methods, and two ORFs were shown to be overexpressed by proteomics and underexpressed by microarray.},

abstract = {A novel biological treatment process for removing hydrogen sulfide from anaerobic biogas using a bioscrubber has been developed. The treatment process is composed of a gas/liquid contact tower and an aeration tank. The biogas from an anaerobic wastewater treatment process is introduced into a multiplebubble-tray contact tower (bio-scrubber) and scrubbed with activated sludge liquor from an aeration tank. The sludge liquor containing sulfides is then returned to the aeration tank, where the sulfide is oxidized to sulfate by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria such as Thiobacillus. The contact tower is designed to be air tight in order to prevent air from mixing into the biogas used as a fuel. A simulation model was developed to calculate effluent gas concentrations from the contact tower, incorporating input parameters such as influent hydrogen sulfide concentrations, gas flow rates, and gas/liquid ratios. Using the simulation model, design criteria were calculated and a full-scale plant for treating biogas from a UASB process for potato processing wastewater was constructed. The data shows that the hydrogen sulfide in the biogas was effectively reduced from 2,000 ppm to less than 20 ppm.},

abstract = {Thin sections, freeze-etched, and negatively stained preparations of Methanocorpusculum sinense cells reveal a highly lobed cell structure with a hexagonally arranged surface layer (S layer). Digital image processing of negatively stained envelope fragments show that the S layer forms a porous but strongly interconnected network. Since the S layer is the exclusive cell envelope component outside the cytoplasmic membrane it must have a cell shape determining and maintaining function. Although lattice faults such as disclinations and dislocations are a geometrical necessity on the surface of a closed protein crystal, our data indicate that they also play important roles as sites for the incorporation of new morphological units, in the formation of the lobed cell structure, and in the cell division process. In freeze-etched preparations of intact cells numerous positive and negative 60 degree wedge disclinations can be detected which form pentagons and heptagons in the hexagonal array. Complementary pairs of pentagons and heptagons are the termination points of edge dislocations. They can be expected to function both as sites for incorporation of new morphological units into the lattice and as initiation points for the cell division process. The latter is determined by the ratio between the increase of protoplast volume and the increase in actual S-layer surface area during cell growth. We postulate that this mode of cell fission represents a common feature in lobed archaebacteria which possess an S layer as the exclusive wall component.},

abstract = {In the present study, thermophilic anaerobic digestion of wheat straw stillage was investigated. Methane potential of stillage was determined in batch experiments at two different substrate concentrations. Results showed that higher methane yields of 324 ml/g-(volatile solids) VSadded were obtained at stillage concentrations of 12.8 g-VS/L than at 25.6 g-VS/l. Continuous anaerobic digestion of stillage was performed in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor at 55 {\^{A}}°C with 2 days hydraulic retention time. Results showed that both substrate concentration and organic loading rate (OLR) influenced process performance and methane yields. Maximum methane yield of 155 ml CH4/g-COD was obtained at stillage mixtures with water of 25{\%} (v/v) in the feed and at an OLR of 17.1 g-COD/(l.d). Soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) removal at this OLR was 76{\%} (w/w). Increase in OLR to 41.2 g-COD/(l.d) and/or stillage concentration in the feed to 33{\^{a}}€“50{\%} (v/v) resulted in low methane yields or complete process failure. The results showed that thermophilic anaerobic digestion of wheat straw stillage alone for methane production is feasible in UASB reactor at an OLR of 17.1 g-COD/(l.d) and at substrate concentration of 25{\%} in the feed. The produced methane could improve the process energy and economics of a bioethanol plant and also enable to utilize the stillage in a sustainable manner.},

abstract = {The use of volatile fatty acids (VFA) as process indicators in biogas reactors treating manure together with industrial waste was studied. At a full-scale biogas plant, an online VFA sensor was installed in order to study VFA dynamics during stable and unstable operation. During stable operation acetate increased significantly during the feeding periods from a level of 2–4 to 12–17mM, but the concentration generally dropped to about the same level as before feeding. The fluctuations in the propionate were more moderate than for acetate but the average level rose during 1 week of operation from 0.6 to 2.9mM. A process disturbance caused by overloading with industrial waste was reflected by a significant increase in all VFA concentrations. During the recovery of the process, the return of propionate back to the steady-state level was 2–3 days slower than any other VFA and propionate could best describe the normalizing of the process. In a lab-scale continuously stirred tank reactor experiment, with manure as main substrate, the prospective of using either propionate concentration or methane production as single process indicators was studied. Propionate was found to be the best indicator. Thus, a process breakdown caused by organic overloading with meat and bone meal and lipids was indicated by changes in propionate concentration 12–18 days before a decrease in methane production was observed. Furthermore, a more efficient and stable utilization of the substrate was observed when propionate was used as process indicator.},

abstract = {Reduced coenzyme F420 (F420H2) is an essential intermediate in methanogenesis from CO2. During methanogenesis from H2 and CO2, F420H2 is provided by the action of F420-reducing hydrogenases. However, an alternative pathway has been proposed, where H2-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Hmd) and F420H2-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Mtd) together reduce F420 with H2. Here we report the construction of mutants of Methanococcus maripaludis that are defective in each putative pathway. Their analysis demonstrates that either pathway supports growth on H2 and CO2. Furthermore, we show that during growth on formate instead of H2, where F420H2 is a direct product of formate oxidation, H2 production occurs. H2 presumably arises from the oxidation of F420H2, and the analysis of the mutants during growth on formate suggests that this too can occur by either pathway. We designate the alternative pathway for the interconversion of H2 and F420H2 the Hmd-Mtd cycle.},

abstract = {The effect of nickel deprivation from the influent of a mesophilic (30°C) methanol fed upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor was investigated by coupling the reactor performance to the evolution of the Methanosarcina population of the bioreactor sludge. The reactor was operated at pH 7.0 and an organic loading rate (OLR) of 5–15 g COD l−1 day−1 for 191 days. A clear limitation of the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) on methanol due to the absence of nickel was observed after 129 days of bioreactor operation: the SMA of the sludge in medium with the complete trace metal solution except nickel amounted to 1.164 (±0.167) g CH4-COD g VSS−1 day−1 compared to 2.027 (±0.111) g CH4-COD g VSS−1 day−1 in a medium with the complete (including nickel) trace metal solution. The methanol removal efficiency during these 129 days was 99{\%}, no volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation was observed and the size of the Methanosarcina population increased compared to the seed sludge. Continuation of the UASB reactor operation with the nickel limited sludge lead to incomplete methanol removal, and thus methanol accumulation in the reactor effluent from day 142 onwards. This methanol accumulation subsequently induced an increase of the acetogenic activity in the UASB reactor on day 160. On day 165, 77{\%} of the methanol fed to the system was converted to acetate and the Methanosarcina population size had substantially decreased. Inclusion of 0.5 $\mu$M Ni (dosed as NiCl2) to the influent from day 165 onwards lead to the recovery of the methanol removal efficiency to 99{\%} without VFA accumulation within 2 days of bioreactor operation.},

Growth and suspended-whole-cell experiments show that H2 plus CO2 methanogenesis was constitutive, while formate methanogenesis required adaptation time; selenium was necessary for formate utilization. Cells grown on formate had 20 to 100 times higher methanogenesis rates on formate than cells grown on H2-CO2 and transferred into formate medium. Enzyme assays with crude extracts and with F420 or methyl viologen as the electron acceptor revealed that hydrogenase was constitutive, while formate dehydrogenase was regulated. Cells grown on formate had 10 to 70 times higher formate dehydrogenase activity than cells grown on H2-CO2 with Se present in the medium; when no Se was added to H2-CO2 cultures, even lower activities were observed. Adaptation to and growth on formate were pH dependent, with an optimal pH for both about one pH unit above that optimal for H2-CO2 (pH 5.8 to 6.5). When cells were grown on H2-CO2 in the presence of formate, formate (greater than or equal to 50 mM) inhibited both growth and methanogenesis at pH 5.8 to 6.2, but not at pH greater than 6.6. Both acetate and propionate produced similar inhibition. Formate inhibition was also observed in Methanospirillum hungatei.},

abstract = {The anaerobic biological treatment of volatile fatty acid (VFA) - and sucrose - based wastewaters was investigated in two anaerobic bioreactors, R1 and R2, over a 300-day trial period. During the trial, the operating temperature of both reactors was lowered, in a stepwise fashion, from 37 to 16 degrees C. The VFA-fed reactor maintained an excellent level of performance, regardless of operating temperature, reaching COD removal efficiencies of 95{\%} at 18 degrees C, and a biogas methane content in excess of 70{\%} at 16 degrees C, at an imposed OLR of 20 kg COD m(-3) d(-1). However, an increase in the applied liquid upflow velocity to the bottom chamber of the reactor from 5 to 7.5 m h(-1)on day 236 resulted in a considerable decline in reactor performance. COD removal efficiencies in excess of 80{\%} were achieved by the sucrose-fed reactor at 18 degrees C, at an imposed OLR of 20 kg COD m(-3) d(-1). An increase in the liquid upflow velocity applied to the sucrose-fed reactor resulted in enhanced reactor performance and stability, with respect to decreasing temperature. The different responses of both reactors to increased upflow velocity was associated with variations in the microbial population structure of the sludges, as determined by culture-independant molecular approaches, specifically the presence of high levels of delta-Proteobacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the VFA-fed biomass. High levels of Methanomicrobiales sp., in particular Methanocorpusculum parvum sp., were observed in both R1 and R2 during the trial. There was a distinct shift from acetoclastic methanogenic dominance to hydrogenotrophic dominance in both reactors in response to a decrease in the operating temperature.},

abstract = {Toxic H2S gas is an important industrial pollutant that is applied to biofiltration. Here, we examined the effects of factors such as inlet concentration and space velocity on the removal efficiency of a bacterial strain capable of tolerating high sulfate concentrations and low pH conditions. We examined three strains of Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans known to have sulfur-oxidizing activity, and identified strain AZ11 as having the highest tolerance for sulfate. A. thiooxidans AZ11 could grow at pH 0.2 in the presence of 74 g l-1 sulfate, the final oxidation product of elemental sulfur, in the culture broth. Under these conditions, the specific sulfur oxidation rate was 2.9 g-S g-DCW (dry cell weight)-1 d-1. The maximum specific sulfur oxidation rate of A. thiooxidans AZ11 was 21.2 g-S g-DCW-1 d-1, which was observed in the presence of 4.2 g-SO42- l-1 and pH 1.5, in the culture medium. To test the effects of various factors on biofiltration by this strain, A. thiooxidans AZ11 was inoculated into a porous ceramic biofilter. First, a maximum inlet loading of 670 g-S m-3 h-1 was applied with a constant space velocity (SV) of 200 h-1 (residence time, 18 s) and the inlet concentration of H2S was experimentally increased from 200 ppmv to 2200 ppmv. Under these conditions, less than 0.1 ppmv H2S was detected at the biofilter outlet. When the inlet H2S was maintained at a constant concentration of 200 ppmv and the SV was increased from 200 h-1 to 400 h-1 (residence time, 9 s), an H2S removal of 99.9{\%} was obtained. However, H2S removal efficiencies decreased to 98{\%} and 94{\%} when the SV was set to 500 h-1 (residence time, 7.2 s) and 600 h-1 (residence time, 6 s), respectively. The critical elimination capacity guaranteeing 96{\%} removal of the inlet H2S was determined to be 160 g-S m-3 h-1 at a space velocity of 600 h-1. Collectively, these findings show for the first time that a sulfur oxidizing bacterium has a high sulfate tolerance and a high sulfur oxidizing activity below pH 1.},

The targets for the real-time PCR assays were the 16S rRNA genes (16S rDNA) for bacteria and Nitrospira spp. and the amoA gene for N. oligotropha. A previously reported assay for AOB 16S rDNA was also tested for its application to activated sludge. The Nitrospira 16S rDNA, AOB 16S rDNA, and N. oligotropha-like amoA assays were log-linear over 6 orders of magnitude and the bacterial 16S rDNA real-time PCR assay was log-linear over 4 orders of magnitude with DNA standards. When these real-time PCR assays were applied to DNA extracted from MLSS, dilution of the DNA extracts was necessary to prevent PCR inhibition. The optimal DNA dilution range was broad for the bacterial 16S rDNA (1000-fold) and Nitrospira 16S rDNA assays (2500-fold) but narrow for the AOB 16S rDNA assay (10-fold) and N. oligotropha-like amoA real-time PCR assay (5-fold). In twelve MLSS samples collected over one year, mean cell per L values were 4.3 +/- 2.0 x 10(11) for bacteria, 3.7 +/- 3.2 x 10(10) for Nitrospira, 1.2 +/- 0.9 x 10(10) for all AOB, and 7.5 +/- 6.0 x 10(9) for N. oligotropha-like AOB. The percent of the nitrifying population was 1.7{\%} N. oligotropha-like AOB based on the N. oligotropha amoA assay, 2.9{\%} total AOB based on the AOB 16S rDNA assay, and 8.6{\%} nitrite-oxidizing bacteria based on the Nitrospira 16S rDNA assay. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in the wastewater treatment plant were estimated to oxidize 7.7 +/- 6.8 fmol/hr/cell based on the AOB 16S rDNA assay and 12.4 +/- 7.3 fmol/hr/cell based on the N. oligotropha amoA assay.},

The methanogenic pathways lead to the formation of a mixed disulfide derived from coenzyme M and coenzyme B. This disulfide is of major importance for methanogens because it is the terminal electron acceptor of a branched respiratory chain. Molecular hydrogen, reduced coenzyme F420 or reduced ferredoxin are used as electron donors. Four enzymes are involved in the membrane-bound electron transport system of Methanosarcina species, all of which are involved in the generation of an electrochemical proton gradient that is used for ATP synthesis. This review focuses on the membrane-bound electron transport chains of Methanosarcina species with respect to the biochemical and genetic characteristics of the unusual energy transducing enzymes. Furthermore, the review addresses questions concerning the relationship between methanogenic proteins and components of respiratory chains found in bacteria and eukarya.},

abstract = {Methane oxidation in soils is mostly accomplished by methanotrophic bacteria. Little is known about the abundance of methanotrophs in soils, since quantification by cultivation and microscopic techniques is cumbersome. Comparison of 16S ribosomal DNA and pmoA (  subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase) phylogenetic trees showed good correlation and revealed five distinct groups of methanotrophs within the   and   subclasses of Proteobacteria: the Methylococcus group, the Methylobacter/Methylosarcina group, the Methylosinus group, the Methylocapsa group, and the forest clones group (a cluster of pmoA sequences retrieved from forest soils). We developed quantitative real-time PCR assays with SybrGreen for each of these five groups and for all methanotrophic bacteria by targeting the pmoA gene. Detection limits were between 101 and 102 target molecules per reaction for all assays. Real-time PCR analysis of soil samples spiked with cells of Methylococcus capsulatus, Methylomicrobium album, and Methylosinus trichosporium recovered almost all the added bacteria. Only the Methylosinus-specific assay recovered only 20{\%} of added cells, possibly due to a lower lysis efficiency of type II methanotrophs. Analysis of the methanotrophic community structure in a flooded rice field soil showed (5.0   1.4)   106 pmoA molecules g 1 for all methanotrophs. The Methylosinus group was predominant (2.7   106   1.1   106 target molecules g 1). In addition, bacteria of the Methylobacter/Methylosarcina group were abundant (2.0   106   0.9   106 target molecules g of soil 1). On the other hand, pmoA affiliated with the forest clones and the Methylocapsa group was below the detection limit of 1.9   104 target molecules g of soil 1. Our results showed that pmoA-targeted real-time PCR allowed fast and sensitive quantification of the five major groups of methanotrophs in soil. This approach will thus be useful for quantitative analysis of the community structure of methanotrophs in nature.},

Cell fixation and hybridization conditions for fluorescence in situ hybridizations were also evaluated. Although permeability of methanogens was variable, M. concilii cells could be permeabilized using a range of paraformaldehyde and ethanol based fixation conditions. Using the newly designed probes together with previously designed probes for methanogens, it was determined that Methanosaeta spp. were the dominant aceticlastic methanogens in a variety of anaerobic bioreactors when acetate concentrations were low. Their levels were higher in bioreactors with granular sludge than in those with flocculent sludge. In lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors, the levels of M. concilii rRNA were as high as 30{\%} of the total rRNA.},

abstract = {A study of NIR as a tool for process monitoring of thermophilic anaerobic digestion boosted by glycerol has been carried out, aiming at developing simple and robust Process Analytical Technology modalities for on-line surveillance in full scale biogas plants. Three 5 L laboratory fermenters equipped with on-line NIR sensor and special sampling stations were used as a basis for chemometric multivariate calibration. NIR characterisation using Transflexive Embedded Near Infra-Red Sensor (TENIRS) equipment integrated into an external recurrent loop on the fermentation reactors, allows for representative sampling, of the highly heterogeneous fermentation bio slurries. Glycerol is an important by-product from the increasing European bio-diesel production. Glycerol addition can boost biogas yields, if not exceeding a limiting 5-7 g L-1 concentration inside the fermenter - further increase can cause strong imbalance in the anaerobic digestion process. A secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of addition of glycerol, in a spiking experiment which introduced increasing organic overloading as monitored by volatile fatty acids (VFA) levels. High correlation between on-line NIR determinations of glycerol and VFA contents has been documented. Chemometric regression models (PLS) between glycerol and NIR spectra needed no outlier removals and only one PLS-component was required. Test set validation resulted in excellent measures of prediction performance, precision: r2 = 0.96 and accuracy = 1.04, slope of predicted versus reference fitting. Similar prediction statistics for acetic acid, iso-butanoic acid and total VFA proves that process NIR spectroscopy is able to quantify all pertinent levels of both volatile fatty acids and glycerol.

abstract = {It is in the interest of operators of anaerobic digestion plants to maximise methane production whilst concomitantly reducing the chemical oxygen demand of the digested material. Although the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion is not a new idea, commercial anaerobic digestion processes are often operated at well below their optimal performance due to a variety of factors. This paper reviews current optimisation techniques associated with anaerobic digestion and suggests possible areas where improvements could be made, including the basic design considerations of a single or multi-stage reactor configuration, the type, power and duration of the mixing regime and the retention of active microbial biomass within the reactor. Optimisation of environmental conditions within the digester such as temperature, pH, buffering capacity and fatty acid concentrations is also discussed. The methane-producing potential of various agriculturally sourced feedstocks has been examined, as has the advantages of co-digestion to improve carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and the use of pre-treatments and additives to improve hydrolysis rates or supplement essential nutrients which may be limiting. However, perhaps the greatest shortfall in biogas production is the lack of reliable sensory equipment to monitor key parameters and suitable, parallelised control systems to ensure that the process continually operates at optimal performance. Modern techniques such as software sensors and powerful, flexible controllers are capable of solving these problems. A direct comparison can be made here with, for instance, oil refineries where a more mature technology uses continuous in situ monitoring and associated feedback procedures to routinely deliver continuous, optimal performance.},

abstract = {A method based on sequence-specific cleavage of rRNA with ribonuclease H was used to detect almost all known cultivable methanogens in anaerobic biological treatment systems. To do so, a total of 40 scissor probes in different phylogeny specificities were designed or modified from previous studies, optimized for their specificities under digestion conditions with 32 methanogenic reference strains, and then applied to detect methanogens in sludge samples taken from 6 different anaerobic treatment processes. Among these processes, known aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic groups of methanogens from the families Methanosarcinaceae, Methanosaetaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanothermaceae and Methanocaldococcaceae could be successfully detected and identified down to the genus level. Within the aceticlastic methanogens, the abundances of mesophilic Methanosaeta accounted for 5.7-48.5{\%} of the total archaeal populations in mesophilic anaerobic processes, and those of Methanosarcina represented 41.7{\%} of the total archaeal populations in thermophilic processes. For hydrogenotrophic methanogens, members of the Methanomicrobiales, Methanobrevibacter and Methanobacterium were detected in mesophilic processes (1.2-17.2{\%}), whereas those of Methanothermobacter, Methanothermaceae and Methanocaldococcaceae were detected in thermophilic process (2.0-4.8{\%}). Overall results suggested that those hierarchical scissor probes developed could be effective for rapid and possibly on-site monitoring of targeted methanogens in different microbial environments.},

abstract = {Deeply buried marine sediments harbour a large fraction of all prokaryotes on Earth but it is still unknown which phylogenetic and physiological microbial groups dominate the deep biosphere. In this study real-time PCR allowed a comparative quantitative microbial community analysis in near-surface and deeply buried marine sediments from the Peru continental margin. The 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of prokaryotes and Bacteria were almost identical with a maximum of 10(8)-10(10) copies cm(-3) in the near-surface sediments. Archaea exhibited one to three orders of magnitude lower 16S rRNA gene copy numbers. The 18S rRNA gene of Eukarya was always at least three orders of magnitude less abundant than the 16S rRNA gene of prokaryotes. The 16S rRNA gene of the Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)-reducing bacterial family Geobacteraceae and the dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase gene (dsrA) of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes were abundant with 10(6)-10(8) copies cm(-3) in near-surface sediments but showed lower numbers and an irregular distribution in the deep sediments. The copy numbers of all genes decreased with sediment depth exponentially. The depth gradients were steeper for the gene copy numbers than for numbers of total prokaryotes (acridine orange direct counts), which reflects the ongoing degradation of the high-molecular-weight DNA with sediment age and depth. The occurrence of eukaryotic DNA also suggests DNA preservation in the deeply buried sediments.},

abstract = {Anaerobic granulation describes the self-immobilisation of methanogenic consortia into dense, particulate biofilms. This procedure underpins the operation of several categories of high-rate anaerobic wastewater treatment system. Full-scale anaerobic granular sludge plants have been generally operated in the mesophilic (20-45 degrees C) or thermophilic (45-65 degrees C) temperature range. On the other hand, recent studies highlighted the economic advantages of treating wastewaters at their discharge temperatures (mostly under 18 degrees C), removing a costly heating process and increasing net biogas yield. However, as yet, relatively little information is available about the microbial behaviour and interactions in anaerobic granular sludge formed under psychrophilic conditions. To this end, and in order to provide a microbial insight into low-temperature anaerobic granulation, we monitored the changes in methanogenic community structure, associated with the changes in process performance. Three, laboratory-scale, expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) bioreactors treating a synthetic glucose wastewater were tested at two temperatures of 37+/-1 degrees C (R1) and 15+/-1 degrees C (R2 and 3). Quantitative real-time PCR and specific methanogenic activity assays highlighted a community shift towards hydrogenotrophic methanogens, particularly the order Methanomicrobiales in the low-temperature bioreactors. Corresponding to this, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis identified the emergence and maintenance of a Methanocorpusculum-like organism. Our results indicate that hydrogenotrophic methanogens, particularly the Methanomicrobiales-related populations, are likely to play important roles in low-temperature anaerobic granular sludge systems. This suggests that the process efficiency could be improved by facilitating the growth and retention of this group.},

abstract = {Granular biomass was temporally sampled from a cold (4-15 degrees C) anaerobic bioreactor, which was inoculated with mesophilic biomass and used to treat industrial wastewater in a long-term (3.4 year) study. Data from 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, quantitative PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses indicated that microbial community structure was dynamic, with shifts in the archaeal and bacterial communities' structures observed following start-up and during temperature decreases from 15 to 9.5 degrees C (phase 1). Specifically, the relative abundance of architecturally important Methanosaeta-like (acetoclastic) methanogens decreased, which was concomitant with granule disintegration and the development of a putatively psychrophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogenic community. Genetic fingerprinting suggested the development of a psychroactive methanogenic community between 4 and 10 degrees C (phase 2), which was dominated by acetogenic bacteria and Methanocorpusculum-like (hydrogenotrophic) methanogens. High levels of Methanosaeta-like acetoclastic methanogens and granular biofilm integrity were maintained during phase 2. Overall, decreasing temperature resulted in distinctly altered microbial community structure during phase 1, and the development of a less dynamic psychroactive methanogenic consortium during phase 2. Moreover, psychrophilic H(2)-oxidizing methanogens emerged as important members of the psychroactive consortia after {\textgreater}1200 days of low-temperature cultivation. The data suggest that prolonged psychrophilic cultivation of mesophilic biomass can establish a well-functioning psychroactive methanogenic consortium, thus highlighting the potential of low-temperature anaerobic digestion technology.},

The batch process was successfully operated with an organic removal efficiency of 35{\%} associated with a 91{\%} decrease in the bacterial 16S rRNA gene concentration. The microbial community structures showed continuous shifts within four bacterial phyla and three archaeal orders. Several bacterial species, such as Fusibacter-related, Clostridium-like, and Syntrophus-like organisms, appeared to be responsible for acidogenesis or syntrophic acid degradation. Both hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogens appear to have been involved in the methanogenesis with the acidogenic products. The quantitative structure of the methanogenic populations varied continuously, with the growth of Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales in series, to result in a Methanomicrobiales-dominant population. The ordination of microbial community structures demonstrated that the quantitative methanogenic structure converged to the seed inoculum while the bacterial and archaeal DGGE band patterns diverged. These results provide an insight into the microbial behavior in the transitional phase (e.g., a start-up period) of anaerobic sludge digestion.},

abstract = {We have recently shown that cell-free transcription of homologous templates from the archaeon Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus requires an archaeal transcription factor (aTFA) that separated from the RNA polymerase during phosphocellulose chromatography. We report here the identification and extensive purification of a second activity, aTFB, required for in vitro transcription. This activity copurified with RNA polymerase during initial chromatographic steps but was positively identified as a distinct transcription factor after Superdex 200 sizing chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the intensity of a M(r) = 28,000 polypeptide in silver-stained gels is correlated with transcription factor activity. The same polypeptide, when eluted from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and subsequently renatured, showed the functional properties of the transcription factor. In conjunction with gel filtration and sedimentation studies, which indicated a molecular mass of 54,000 Da for the native protein, these results suggested that aTFB is a dimer with polypeptide chains of identical molecular mass. Functional studies with highly purified aTFB demonstrated that it is a general factor required for transcription of genes encoding tRNA and proteins.},

The batch process was successfully operated with an organic removal efficiency of 35{\%} associated with a 91{\%} decrease in the bacterial 16S rRNA gene concentration. The microbial community structures showed continuous shifts within four bacterial phyla and three archaeal orders. Several bacterial species, such as Fusibacter-related, Clostridium-like, and Syntrophus-like organisms, appeared to be responsible for acidogenesis or syntrophic acid degradation. Both hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogens appear to have been involved in the methanogenesis with the acidogenic products. The quantitative structure of the methanogenic populations varied continuously, with the growth of Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales in series, to result in a Methanomicrobiales-dominant population. The ordination of microbial community structures demonstrated that the quantitative methanogenic structure converged to the seed inoculum while the bacterial and archaeal DGGE band patterns diverged. These results provide an insight into the microbial behavior in the transitional phase (e.g., a start-up period) of anaerobic sludge digestion.},

abstract = {DNA topoisomerase V is a novel prokaryotic enzyme related to eukaryotic topoisomerase I. The enzyme is a type I DNA topoisomerase and is recognized by polyclonal antibody against human topoisomerase I. We describe its purification from the hyperthermophilic methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri. The enzyme has high activity in crude extracts and is present in at least 1,500 copies/cell. Topoisomerase V migrates as a 110-kDa polypeptide in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and as a 142-kDa globular protein in gel filtration. It is active up to at least 100 degrees C on both positively and negatively supercoiled DNA and is not inhibited by single-stranded DNA. The enzyme works from 1 to 650 mM NaCl and up to 3.1 M potassium glutamate. It acts processively at low ionic strength and distributively at high NaCl or KCl concentration. Magnesium is not required and does not stimulate the enzymatic activity. Under DNA denaturing conditions, topoisomerase V catalyzes an unlinking reaction which results in substantial reduction in the linking number of closed circular DNA. The driving force for this process is DNA melting. Camptothecin is not nearly as good an inhibitor for topoisomerase V as it is for eukaryotic topoisomerase I. The unique occurrence of two major type I topoisomerases (reverse gyrase and topoisomerase V) in M. kandleri may shed new light on the evolution of this family of enzymes and supports the concept of a distant but significant relationship between some hyperthermophilic organisms and eukaryotes.},

A naturally developed microbial community in a pulp mill wastewater storage pool that had been disused were investigated in this study. Owing to natural evaporation and a huge amount of lignocellulose's deposition, the wastewater sediment contains high concentrations of organic matters and sodium ions, but low concentrations of chloride and carbonate. The microbiota inhabiting especially anaerobic community, including methanogenic arhcaea and cellulolytic species, was studied. All archaeal sequences fall into 2 clusters of family Halobacteriaceae and methanogenic archaeon in the phylum Euryarchaeota. In the methanogenic community, phylogenetic analysis of methyl coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA) genes targeted to novel species in genus Methanoculleus or novel genus of order Methanomicrobiales. The predominance of Methanomicrobiales suggests that methanogenesis in this system might be driven by the hydrogenotrophic pathway. As the important primary fermenter for methane production, the cellulolytic community of enzyme GHF48 was found to be dominated by narrower breadth of novel clostridial cellulase genes. Novel anoxic functional members in such extreme sediment provide the possibility of enhancing the efficiency of anoxic treatment of saline and alkaline wastewaters, as well as benefiting to the biomass transformation and biofuel production processes.},

We developed primers and probes based on the 16S ribosomal DNA gene sequences for the detection of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides vulgatus. DNA was isolated from pure cultures and from gut biopsy specimens and quantified by the 5' nuclease PCR assay. The assay showed a very high sensitivity: as little as 1 CFU of E. coli and 9 CFU of B. vulgatus could be detected. The specificities of the primer-probe combinations were evaluated with samples that were spiked with the species most closely related to E. coli and B. vulgatus and with eight other gut microflora species. Mucosal samples spiked with known amounts of E. coli or B. vulgatus DNA showed no PCR inhibition. We conclude that the 5' nuclease PCR assay may be a useful alternative to conventional culture techniques to study the actual in vivo composition of a complex microbial community like the gut microflora.},

abstract = {Neutral fat hydrolysis and long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) oxidation rates were determined during the digestion of slaughterhouse wastewater in anaerobic sequencing batch reactors operated at 25°C. The experimental substrate consisted of filtered slaughterhouse wastewater supplemented with pork fat particles at various average initial sizes (Din) ranging from 60 to 450 {\&}mgr;m. At the Din tested, there was no significant particle size effect on the first-order hydrolysis rate. The neutral fat hydrolysis rate averaged 0.63 ± 0.07 d-1. LCFA oxidation rate was modelled using a Monod-type equation. The maximum substrate utilization rate (kmax) and the half-saturation concentration (Ks) averaged 164 ± 37 mg LCFA/L/d and 35 ± 31 mg LCFA/L, respectively. Pork fat particle degradation was mainly controlled by LCFA oxidation rate and, to a lesser extent, by neutral fat hydrolysis rate. Hydrolysis pretreatment of fat-containing wastewaters and sludges should not substantially accelerate their anaerobic treatment. At a Din of 450 {\&}mgr;m, fat particles were found to inhibit methane production during the initial 20 h of digestion. Inhibition of methane production in the early phase of digestion was the only significant effect of fat particle size on anaerobic digestion of pork slaughterhouse wastewater. Soluble COD could not be used to determine the rate of lipid hydrolysis due to LCFA adsorption on the biomass. {\textcopyright} 2002 Government of Canada.

Methanogenic archaea are ubiquitous on earth and produce a large amount of methane (CH(4)) as their main carbon metabolite. Methanogens are the most laboratory amendable archaea. The few psychrophilic archaea that have been cultured to date are mainly affiliated with methanogens, thus make them a good model for investigating mechanisms of archaeal cold adaptation. Studies of psychrotolerant methanogens have been ongoing since the 1990s. Using Methanococcoides burtonii, a methanogen isolated from Ace Lake in Antarctica, extensive studies on the genomic characteristics associated with cold adaptation have been carried out by the Cavicchioli laboratory. We recently analyzed the genome of another psychrophilic methanogen and identified the gene repertoire associated with cold adaptation. This review summarizes recent studies of psychroactive methanogens, particularly their diversity, the genomics and proteomics associated with their cold adaptation, and the cellular components and proteins likely involved in their cold protection.},

abstract = {Granular biomass was temporally sampled from a cold (4-15 degrees C) anaerobic bioreactor, which was inoculated with mesophilic biomass and used to treat industrial wastewater in a long-term (3.4 year) study. Data from 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, quantitative PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses indicated that microbial community structure was dynamic, with shifts in the archaeal and bacterial communities' structures observed following start-up and during temperature decreases from 15 to 9.5 degrees C (phase 1). Specifically, the relative abundance of architecturally important Methanosaeta-like (acetoclastic) methanogens decreased, which was concomitant with granule disintegration and the development of a putatively psychrophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogenic community. Genetic fingerprinting suggested the development of a psychroactive methanogenic community between 4 and 10 degrees C (phase 2), which was dominated by acetogenic bacteria and Methanocorpusculum-like (hydrogenotrophic) methanogens. High levels of Methanosaeta-like acetoclastic methanogens and granular biofilm integrity were maintained during phase 2. Overall, decreasing temperature resulted in distinctly altered microbial community structure during phase 1, and the development of a less dynamic psychroactive methanogenic consortium during phase 2. Moreover, psychrophilic H(2)-oxidizing methanogens emerged as important members of the psychroactive consortia after {\textgreater}1200 days of low-temperature cultivation. The data suggest that prolonged psychrophilic cultivation of mesophilic biomass can establish a well-functioning psychroactive methanogenic consortium, thus highlighting the potential of low-temperature anaerobic digestion technology.},

The archaea include the methanogens, extreme halophiles, thermoplasmas, sulfate reducers and sulfur metabolizing thermophiles, which thrive in different habitats such as anaerobic niches, salt lakes, and marine hydrothermals systems and continental solfataras. Many of these habitats represent extreme environments in respect to temperature, osmotic pressure and pH-values and remind on the conditions of the early earth. The cell envelope structures were one of the first biochemical characteristics of archaea studied in detail. The most common archaeal cell envelope is composed of a single crystalline protein or glycoprotein surface layer (S-layer), which is associated with the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. The S-layers are directly exposed to the extreme environment and can not be stabilized by cellular components. Therefore, from comparative studies of mesophilic and extremely thermophilic S-layer proteins hints can be obtained about the molecular mechanisms of protein stabilization at high temperatures. First crystallization experiments of surface layer proteins under microgravity conditions were successful. Here, we report on the biochemical features of selected mesophilic and extremely archaeal S-layer (glyco-) proteins.},

This model is based on the premise that degradable components of such substrates are first hydrolyzed into soluble monomers, which are then fermented to liquid and gaseous end products. The model considered cellulose and hemicellulose as the degradable components of typical biomass-based organic substrates; and volatile fatty acids, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide as the end products. Hydrolysis of the particulate forms of the components is modeled by a surface-limiting rate equation, and the formation of end products is modeled following the guidelines of the anaerobic digestion model (ADM1). The model was calibrated and validated using experimental COD and VFA data from six batch reactors where, cattle manure was tested as a representative biomass-based substrate. The model predictions agreed well with the temporal trend in the experimental data, with overall r2 of 0.85 for COD, 0.82 for acetic acid, 0.72 for butyric acid, and 0.42 for propionic acid.},

Each oligonucleotide probe entry contains information on target organisms, target molecule (small- or large-subunit rRNA) and position, G+C content, predicted melting temperature, molecular weight, necessity of competitor probes, and the reference that originally described the oligonucleotide probe, including a link to the respective abstract at PubMed. In addition, probes successfully used for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are highlighted and the recommended hybridization conditions are listed. ProbeBase also offers difference alignments for 16S rRNA-targeted probes by using the probe match tool of the ARB software and the latest small-subunit rRNA ARB database (release June 2002). The option to directly submit probe sequences to the probe match tool of the Ribosomal Database Project II (RDP-II) further allows one to extract supplementary information on probe specificities. The two main features of probeBase, {\^{a}}€ search probeBase{\^{a}}€™ and {\^{a}}€ find probe set{\^{a}}€™, help researchers to find suitable, published oligonucleotide probes for microorganisms of interest or for rRNA gene sequences submitted by the user. Furthermore, the {\^{a}}€ search target site{\^{a}}€™ option provides guidance for the development of new FISH probes.},

abstract = {The anaerobic digestion model No. 1 (ADM1), conceived by the international water association (IWA) task group for mathematical modelling of anaerobic digestion processes is a structured generic model which includes multiples steps describing biochemical and physicochemical processes encountered in the anaerobic degradation of complex organic substrates and a common platform for further model enhancement and validation of dynamic simulations for a variety of anaerobic processes. In this study the ADM1 model was modified and applied to simulate the mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion of olive mill wastewater (OMW) with olive mill solid waste (OMSW). The ADM1 equations were coded and implemented using the simulation software package MATLAB/Simulink. The most sensitive parameters were calibrated and validated using updated experimental data of our previous work. The results indicated that the ADM1 model could simulate with good accuracy: gas flows, methane and carbon-dioxide contents, pH and total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) concentrations of effluents for various feed concentrations digested at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) and especially at HRTs of 36 and 24 days. Furthermore, effluent alkalinity and ammonium nitrogen were successfully predicted by the model at HRTs of 12 and 24 days for some feed concentrations.},

This is the first published report of proteins from thermophiles being stabilized by pressure. Inactivation studies of partially purified hydrogenases from an extreme thermophile (Methanococcus igneus), a moderate thermophile (Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus), and a mesophile (Methanococcus maripaludis), all from shallow marine sites, show that pressure stabilization is not unique to enzymes isolated from high-pressure environments. These studies suggest that pressure stabilization of an enzyme may be related to its thermophilicity. Further experiments comparing the effects of increased pressure on the stability of alpha-glucosidases from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae support this possibility. We have also examined pressure effects on several highly homologous glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases from mesophilic and thermophilic sources and a rubredoxin from P. furiosus. The results suggest that hydrophobic interactions, which have been implicated in the stabilization of many thermophilic proteins, contribute to the pressure stabilization of enzymes from thermophiles.},

The specified phenotypic characteristics are often not sufficient to distinguish among taxa or to determine the phylogenetic placement of a taxon, and, in these cases, additional chemotaxonomic, molecular, or genetic data may be required. The placement of a new taxon should be consistent with phylogeny, usually based on tests such as nucleic acid sequencing or cataloging studies or on protein fingerprinting.

There is thus a need for a model to simulate the anaerobic digestion processes used in their treatment. We have developed model based on ADM1, to be applied to agro-wastes. We examined and tested the biodegradability of apple, pear, orange, rape, sunflower, pig manure and glycerol wastes to be used as the basis for feeding the model. Moreover, the fractions of particulate COD (Xc) were calculated, and the disintegration constant was obtained from biodegradability profiles, considering disintegration to be the limiting process. The other kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were taken from the ADM1 model. The model operating under mono-substrate and co-substrate conditions was then validated with batch tests. At the same time the model was validated on a continuous anaerobic reactor operating with pig manure at lab scale. In both cases the correlation between the model and the experimental results was satisfactory. We conclude that the anaerobic digestion model is a reliable tool for the design and operation of plants in which agro-wastes are treated.},

The model considered cellulose and hemicellulose as the degradable components of typical biomass-based organic substrates; and volatile fatty acids, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide as the end products. Hydrolysis of the particulate forms of the components is modeled by a surface-limiting rate equation, and the formation of end products is modeled following the guidelines of the anaerobic digestion model (ADM1). The model was calibrated and validated using experimental COD and VFA data from six batch reactors where, cattle manure was tested as a representative biomass-based substrate. The model predictions agreed well with the temporal trend in the experimental data, with overall r2 of 0.85 for COD, 0.82 for acetic acid, 0.72 for butyric acid, and 0.42 for propionic acid.},

However, the typical sigmoid-shape increase in time of the disintegration/hydrolysis rates cannot be described with first-order models. For complex substrates, first-order kinetics should thus be modified to account for slowly degradable material. In this study, a slightly modified IWA ADM1 model is presented to simulate thermophilic anaerobic digestion of thermally pretreated waste activated sludge. Contois model is first included for disintegration and hydrolysis steps instead of first-order kinetics and Hill function is then used to model ammonia inhibition of aceticlastic methanogens instead of a non-competitive function. One batch experimental data set of anaerobic degradation of a raw waste activated sludge is used to calibrate the proposed model and three additional data sets from similar sludge thermally pretreated at three different temperatures are used to validate the parameters values.},

The model implemented was initiated to support experimental investigations of the anaerobic two-stage digestion process. The model concept implemented in the simulation software package MATLABTM/Simulinks is a derivative of the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No.1 (ADM1) that has been developed by the IWA task group for mathematical modelling of anaerobic processes. In the present study the original model concept has been adapted and applied to replicate a two-stage digestion process. Testing procedures, including balance checks and ‘benchmarking' tests were carried out to verify the accuracy of the implementation. These combined measures ensured a faultless model implementation without numerical inconsistencies. Parameters for both, the thermophilic and the mesophilic process stage, have been estimated successfully using data from lab-scale experiments described in literature. Due to the high number of parameters in the structured model, it was necessary to develop a customised procedure that limited the range of parameters to be estimated. The accuracy of the optimised parameter sets has been assessed against experimental data from pilot-scale experiments. Under these conditions, the model predicted reasonably well the dynamic behaviour of a two-stage digestion process in pilot scale.},

ATP synthases are assumed to be driven either by H(+) or Na(+), reflecting distinct structural motifs in their membrane domains, and distinct metabolisms of the host organisms. Here, we study the methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans using assays of ATP hydrolysis and ion transport in inverted membrane vesicles, and experimentally demonstrate that the rotary mechanism of its ATP synthase is coupled to the concurrent translocation of both H(+) and Na(+) across the membrane under physiological conditions. Using free-energy molecular simulations, we explain this unprecedented observation in terms of the ion selectivity of the binding sites in the membrane rotor, which appears to have been tuned via amino acid substitutions so that ATP synthesis in M. acetivorans can be driven by the H(+) and Na(+) gradients resulting from methanogenesis. We propose that this promiscuity is a molecular mechanism of adaptation to life at the thermodynamic limit.},

abstract = {Anaerobic digestion is a multistep process, mediated by a functionally and phylogenetically diverse microbial population. One of the crucial steps is oxidation of organic acids, with electron transfer via hydrogen or formate from acetogenic bacteria to methanogens. This syntrophic microbiological process is strongly restricted by a thermodynamic limitation on the allowable hydrogen or formate concentration. In order to study this process in more detail, we developed an individual-based biofilm model which enables to describe the processes at a microbial resolution. The biochemical model is the ADM1, implemented in a multidimensional domain. With this model, we evaluated three important issues for the syntrophic relationship: (i) Is there a fundamental difference in using hydrogen or formate as electron carrier? (ii) Does a thermodynamic-based inhibition function produced substantially different results from an empirical function? and; (iii) Does the physical co-location of acetogens and methanogens follow directly from a general model. Hydrogen or formate as electron carrier had no substantial impact on model results. Standard inhibition functions or thermodynamic inhibition function gave similar results at larger substrate field grid sizes ({\textgreater}10 [mu]m), but at smaller grid sizes, the thermodynamic-based function reduced the number of cells with long interspecies distances ({\textgreater}2.5 [mu]m). Therefore, a very fine grid resolution is needed to reflect differences between the thermodynamic function, and a more generic inhibition form. The co-location of syntrophic bacteria was well predicted without a need to assume a microbiological based mechanism (e.g., through chemotaxis) of biofilm formation.},

The propionate degradation rate amounted to 1.1 mmol per g volatile suspended solids per day. The same propionate degradation rate was measured in the presence of 10 mM acetate, but it decreased by 30{\%} when 10 mM n-butyrate was added. 13C-Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated interconversion of 1{\%} to 10{\%} of both the propionate and butyrate pool, during their simultaneous degradation. Propionate formation from [2-13C]butyrate was not via a direct decarboxylation. 13C-Propionate was converted via at least three different pathways. The first pathway was syntrophic conversion of propionate via the randomising pathway, evidenced by scrambling of [3-13C]propionate into [2-13C]propionate. Secondly, reductive carboxylation occurred, i.e. [3-13C]propionate and [2,3-13C]propionate were partly (2 to 10{\%}) converted into [4-13C]butyrate and [3,4-13C]butyrate, respectively. Reductive carboxylation probably involved a transcarboxylase, as 13C-bicarbonate was not incorporated in the carboxyl group of butyrate. Thirdly, propionate was converted into higher fatty acids: [2,3-13C]propionate was converted into [4,5-13C]valerate and 2-methyl[2,3-13C]butyrate.},

abstract = {The frequent discrepancy between direct microscopic counts and numbers of culturable bacteria from environmental samples is just one of several indications that we currently know only a minor part of the diversity of microorganisms in nature. A combination of direct retrieval of rRNA sequences and whole-cell oligonucleotide probing can be used to detect specific rRNA sequences of uncultured bacteria in natural samples and to microscopically identify individual cells. Studies have been performed with microbial assemblages of various complexities ranging from simple two-component bacterial endosymbiotic associations to multispecies enrichments containing magnetotactic bacteria to highly complex marine and soil communities. Phylogenetic analysis of the retrieved rRNA sequence of an uncultured microorganism reveals its closest culturable relatives and may, together with information on the physicochemical conditions of its natural habitat, facilitate more directed cultivation attempts. For the analysis of complex communities such as multispecies biofilms and activated-sludge flocs, a different approach has proven advantageous. Sets of probes specific to different taxonomic levels are applied consecutively beginning with the more general and ending with the more specific (a hierarchical top-to-bottom approach), thereby generating increasingly precise information on the structure of the community. Not only do rRNA-targeted whole-cell hybridizations yield data on cell morphology, specific cell counts, and in situ distributions of defined phylogenetic groups, but also the strength of the hybridization signal reflects the cellular rRNA content of individual cells. From the signal strength conferred by a specific probe, in situ growth rates and activities of individual cells might be estimated for known species. In many ecosystems, low cellular rRNA content and/or limited cell permeability, combined with background fluorescence, hinders in situ identification of autochthonous populations. Approaches to circumvent these problems are discussed in detail.},

The archaea were characterized by their 16S rRNA genes. An archaeal 16S rDNA clone library was constructed from the DNA isolated from the formation water, and 237 randomly selected positive clones were clustered in 28 phylotypes by sequencing analyses. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences indicated that the dominant members of the archaeal phylotypes were affiliated with the order Methanomicrobiales. Totally, the archaeal community was composed of methanogens belonging to four orders: Methanobacteriales, Methanococcales, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosarcinales. Most of the clones clustered with sequences previously described for methanogens, but there was a difference in the relative distribution of sequences detected here as compared to that of previous studies. Some thermophilic methanogens detected had been previously isolated from a number of high-temperature petroleum reservoirs worldwide; thus, they might exhibit adaptations to the environments and be the common habitants of geothermally heated subsurface environments.},

On the other hand, immobilized bacteria could be concentrated only 10 times. The cell densities of the immobilized methanogenic archaea and bacteria were higher than those of the free-living methanogenic archaea and bacteria in the reactor. The results of clone analysis indicate that the major methanogenic archaea of the original thermophilic sludge are members of the order Methanomicrobiales, and that the major methanogenic archaea immobilized on the polyurethane foam are Methanosarcina spp., and those of the liquid phase are Methanobacterium spp. The results of the real time PCR analysis approximately agree with those of the clone analysis.

The generation time at optimal conditions is less than 5 h. Cysteine must be supplied in the growth medium. It can act as sole sulfur source. The addition of sulfide accelerates the growth at an optimum concentration of 10-4 to 10-5 molar. A growth factor, not identical with SH-coenzyme M, occurring in anaerobic sewage sludge and yeast extract shows a stimulatory effect. 7.0–8.2{\%} of the total carbon dioxide uptake is assimilated and 11.2{\%} of the energy obtained from the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane is refound in the caloric value of the biomass. 0.01 ppm of dissolved oxygen completely inhibits growth and methane production. However, the bacteria do not loose their viability when exposed to high oxygen concentrations. Further informations are needed before this organism (DSM 744) is specifically identified.},

abstract = {In view of the realization that fossil fuels reserves are limited, various options of generating energy are being explored. Biological methods for producing fuels such as ethanol, diesel, hydrogen (H2), methane, etc. have the potential to provide a sustainable energy system for the society. Biological H2 production appears to be the most promising as it is non-polluting and can be produced from water and biological wastes. The major limiting factors are low yields, lack of industrially robust organisms, and high cost of feed. Actually, H2 yields are lower than theoretically possible yields of 4 mol/mol of glucose because of the associated fermentation products such as lactic acid, propionic acid and ethanol. The efficiency of energy production can be improved by screening microbial diversity and easily fermentable feed materials. Biowastes can serve as feed for H2 production through a set of microbial consortia: (1) hydrolytic bacteria, (2) H2 producers (dark fermentative and photosynthetic). The efficiency of the bioconversion process may be enhanced further by the production of value added chemicals such as polydroxyalkanoate and anaerobic digestion. Discovery of enormous microbial diversity and sequencing of a wide range of organisms may enable us to realize genetic variability, identify organisms with natural ability to acquire and transmit genes. Such organisms can be exploited through genome shuffling for transgenic expression and efficient generation of clean fuel and other diverse biotechnological applications.},

To investigate the hypothesis that these two disparate environments have distinct methanogenic communities, the methanogens in an oligotrophic acidic fen and a mesophilic anaerobic digester treating municipal wastewater sludge were characterized by creating clone libraries for the 16S rRNA and methyl coenzyme M reductase alpha subunit (mcrA) genes. A quantitative framework was developed to assess the differences between these two communities by calculating the average sequence similarity for 16S rRNA genes and mcrA within a genus and family using sequences of isolated and characterized methanogens within the approved methanogen taxonomy. The average sequence similarities for 16S rRNA genes within a genus and family were 96.0 and 93.5{\%}, respectively, and the average sequence similarities for mcrA within a genus and family were 88.9 and 79{\%}, respectively. The clone libraries of the bog and digester environments showed no overlap at the species level and almost no overlap at the family level. Both libraries were dominated by clones related to uncultured methanogen groups within the Methanomicrobiales, although members of the Methanosarcinales and Methanobacteriales were also found in both libraries. Diversity indices for the 16S rRNA gene library of the bog and both mcrA libraries were similar, but these indices indicated much lower diversity in the 16S digester library than in the other three libraries.},

abstract = {The diversity of methanogenic archaea in enrichment cultures established from the sediments of Lonar Lake (India), a soda lake having pH approximately 10, was investigated using 16S rDNA molecular phylogenetic approach. Methanogenic enrichment cultures were developed in a medium that simulated conditions of soda lake with three different substrates viz., H(2):CO(2), sodium acetate, and trimethylamine (TMA), at alkaline pH. Archaeal 16S rRNA clone libraries were generated from enrichment cultures and 13 RFLP groups were obtained. Representative sequence analysis of each RFLP group indicated that the majority of the 16S rRNA gene sequences were phylogenetically affiliated with uncultured Archaea. Some of the groups may belong to new archaeal genera or families. Three RFLP groups were related to Methanoculleus sp, while two related to Methanocalculus sp. 16S rRNA gene sequences found in Lonar Lake were different from sequences reported from other soda lakes and more similar to those of oil reservoirs, palm oil waste treatment digesters, and paddy fields. In culture-based studies, three isolates were obtained. Two of these were related to Methanoculleus sp. IIE1 and one to Methanocalculus sp. 01F97C. These results clearly show that the Lonar Lake ecosystem harbors unexplored methanogens.},

abstract = {Changes in lactose concentration and feed rate altered bacterial growth and population levels in a whey-processing chemostat. The bacterial population and methane production levels increased in relation to increased lactose concentrations comparable to those in raw whey (6{\%}) and converted over 96{\%} of the substrate to methane, carbon dioxide, and cells. Sequential increases in the chemostat dilution rate demonstrated excellent biomethanation performance at retention times as low as 25 h. Retention times shorter than 25 h caused prevalent bacterial populations and methane production to decrease, and intermediary carbon metabolites accumulated in the following order: acetate, butyrate, propionate, lactate, ethanol, and lactose. Bacterial species dominated in the chemostat as a function of their enhanced substrate uptake and growth kinetic properties. The substrate uptake kinetic properties displayed by the mixed chemostat population were equivalent to those of individual species measured in pure culture, whereas the growth kinetic properties of species in mixed culture were better than those measured in pure culture. A designed starter culture consisting of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Methanosarcina barkeri, and Methanobacterium formicicum displayed biomethanation performance, which was similar to that of a diverse adapted mixed-culture inoculum, in a continuous contact digestor system to which 10 g of dry whey per liter was added. Preserved starter cultures were developed and used as inocula for the start-up of a continuous anaerobic digestion process that was effective for biomethanation of raw whey at a retention time of 100 h.},

abstract = {The phylogeny and taxonomy of the mesophilic methane-producing archaea of the order Methanococcales were examined by DNA relatedness, 16S rRNA sequence analysis, cellular protein patterns, and phenotypic methods. The mesophilic species Methanococcus maripaludis, Methanococcus vannielii, Methanococcus voltaei, and "Methanococcus aeolicus" formed a deep group with 5 to 30{\%} DNA relatedness and 92 to 96{\%} 16S rRNA sequence similarity. Twenty-two additional isolates and Methanococcus deltae were similar to the type strain of either M. voltaei or M. maripaludis. Two isolates, strains A2 and A3, exhibited 37{\%} DNA relatedness and 99.2{\%} 16S rRNA sequence similarity to M. voltaei PS(T) (T = type strain). In the absence of phenotypic differences, these organisms were assigned to M. voltaei. Similarly, four autotrophic isolates, strains C5, C6, C7, and C8, exhibited 54 to 69{\%} DNA relatedness and 99.2{\%} 16S rRNA sequence similarity to M. maripaludis JJT and were assigned to M. Maripaludis. While these isolates were sufficiently genetically diverse to justify classification in novel species, few differences were apparent in the phenotypic properties available for measurement. Thus, the phenotypic properties of these lithotrophic archaea were highly conserved and poor indicators of genetic diversity. Partial sequencing of about 200 bases of both the 16S and 23S rRNAs of the isolates demonstrated allelic diversity within methanococcal species. This allelic diversity did not correlate with diversity measured by DNA relatedness, cellular protein pattern, and other methods. Similarly, antisera to whole cells of the type strains did not cross-react strongly to whole cells of strains that were genetically similar, and serological cross-reactivity was not a useful taxonomic method for methanococci. Lastly, on the basis of the results of 16S rRNA sequence analyses and biochemical data, the ancestor of the mesophilic methanococci may have been an autotrophic thermophile.},

Small-subunit rRNA (16S rDNA) from salt pan sediment metagenome were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific to the domain archaea. Thirty-two unique phylotypes were obtained by PCR-based RFLP of 16S rRNA genes using endonucleases Hae111 and Msp1, which were most suitable to score the genetic diversity. These phylotypes spanned a wide range within the domain Archaea including both Crenarchaeota and Euryarcheaota. However, none of the retrieved Crenarchaeota sequences could be grouped with previously cultured Crenarchaeota. Of all the Euryarcheaota sequences, three sequences were related to Haloarchaea, two were related to cultured Methanosarcina sp., and the remaining sequences were affiliated with uncultured Methanosarcina sp., Methanogenium sp., and Methanolobus sp. Most of the sequences determined were closely related to the sequences that had been previously obtained from metagenome of a variety of marine environments. The phylogenetic study of a site investigated for the first time revealed the presence of a highly diverse archaeal population and may represent novel sequences and organisms specially adapted to the salt pan sediment of Mumbai. These findings are of fundamental value for understanding the complexity of salt pan ecosystems.},

abstract = {The anaerobic free-living ciliate, Trimyema compressum, is known to harbor both methanogenic archaeal and bacterial symbionts in the cytoplasm. To clarify their phylogenetic belongings, a full-cycle rRNA approach was applied to this symbiosis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the methanogenic symbiont was related to Methanobrevibacter arboriphilicus, which was distantly related to symbionts found in other Trimyema species. This result suggested that Trimyema species do not require very specific methanogenic symbionts, and symbiont replacement could have occurred in the history of Trimyema species. On the other hand, the bacterial symbiont was located near the lineage of the family Syntrophomonadaceae in the phylum Firmicutes. The sequence similarity between the bacterial symbiont and the nearest species was 85{\%}, indicating that bacterial symbionts may be specific to the Trimyema species. The elimination of bacterial symbionts from the ciliate cell by antibiotic treatment resulted in considerably decreased host growth. However, it was not restored by stigmasterol addition ({\textless}2 microg ml(-1)), which was different from the previous report that showed that the symbiont-free strain required exogenous sterols for growth. In addition, the decline of host growth was not accompanied by host metabolism shift toward the formation of more reduced products, which suggested that the contribution of bacterial symbionts to the host ciliate was not a dispose of excessive reducing equivalent arising from the host's fermentative metabolism as methanogenic symbionts do. This study showed that bacterial symbionts make a significant contribution to the host ciliate by an unknown function and suggested that interactions between bacterial symbionts and T. compressum are more complicated than hitherto proposed.},

abstract = {Methanococcus maripaludis, a facultatively autotrophic archaebacterium that grows with H2 or formate as the electron donor, does not assimilate sugars and other complex organic substrates. However, glycogen is biosynthesized intracellularly and commonly reaches values of 0.34{\%} of the cellular dry weight in the early stationary phase. To determine the pathway of glycogen catabolism, specific enzymes of sugar metabolism were assayed in cell extracts. The following enzymes were found (specific activity in milliunits per milligram of protein): glycogen phosphorylase, 4.4; phosphoglucomutase, 10; glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 9; 6-phosphofructokinase, 5.6, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, 10; fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, 4.2; triosephosphate isomerase, 44; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 26; phosphoglycerate kinase, 20; phosphoglycerate mutase, 78; enolase, 107; and pyruvate kinase, 4.0. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was NADP+ dependent, and the pyruvate kinase required MnCl2. The 6-phosphofructokinase had an unusually low pH optimum of 6.0. Four nonoxidative pentose-biosynthetic enzymes were found (specific activity in milliunits per milligram of protein): transketolase, 12; transaldolase, 24; ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase, 55; and ribulose-5-phosphate isomerase, 100. However, the key enzymes of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the reductive pentose phosphate pathway, and the classical and modified Entner-Duodoroff pathways were not detected. Thus, glycogen appears to be catabolized by the Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway. This result is in striking contrast to the nonmethanogenic archaebacteria that have been examined, among which the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is common. A dithiothreitol-specific NADP(+)-reducing activity was also found (8.5 mU/mg of protein). Other thiol compounds, such as cysteine hydrochloride, reduced glutathione, and 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, did not replace dithiothreitol for this activity. The physiological significance of this activity is not known.},

In these solution, this gas was not very stable and was quickly liberated. However, at low concentration (less than 5 ppm) it becomes stable and could only be removed from solution by oxidation. The results obtained indicated that the presence of either T. ferrooxidans or T. thiooxidans causes a significant reduction in H2S concentration (more than 99{\%}) in relation to the sterile control. No differences in oxidation efficiency between these two species were detected.},

abstract = {A mixed methanogenic culture was highly enriched in a growth medium containing propionate as the sole organic carbon and energy source. With this culture, the pathways of propionate degradation were studied by use of 14C-radiotracers. Propionate was first metabolized to acetate, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen by nonmethanogenic organisms. Formate was not excreted. The carbon dioxide originated exclusively from the carboxyl group of propionate, whereas both [2-14C]- and [3-14C]propionate lead to the production of radioactive acetate. The methyl and carboxyl groups of the acetate produced were equally labeled, regardless of whether [2-14C]- or [3-14C]propionate was used. These observations suggest that in the culture, propionate was degraded through a randomizing pathway.},

abstract = {The performance and the behaviour of the microbial community of an anaerobic mesophilic biogas digester fed with the sugar beet silage (SBS) were investigated in this laboratory-scale work. The biogas digester was operated using a fuzzy logic control (FLC) technique, which was developed at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. The SBS, which had extremely low pH of 3.3-3.4, was used as mono-input, without addition of manure. The main objective of this study was to achieve and maintain a stable and safe anaerobic conversion process, along with satisfactory process efficiency. With use of FLC, the biogas digester could be operated with hydraulic retention times (HRTs) in the range 8-25 days, and up to an organic loading rate (OLR) of 7.41 g volatile solids [VS] l-1 d-1. The average levels of the specific gas production (GP) rate (SGPR) and the volumetric GP rate (VGPR) were 0.55 l g [VS]-1 d-1 and 3 l l-1 d-1, respectively, with 66{\%} of methane (CH4) content in digester biogas. Despite the SBS having an extremely low pH, low amounts of nutrients and buffering capacity, instability problems were not encountered during the experimental period of 156 days, as indicated by the neutral range of the digester pH and the high OLR applied. A daily addition of 1 M KHCO3 to the digester also provided adequate buffering capacity. The application of the FLC also exhibited a positive effect on the methanogenic population. After starting the FLC, the methanogenic population doubled from 4.80 × 108 to 1.19 × 109 cells ml-1 at the end of the investigation period, whereas the number of the total bacteria remained constant around 2.27-2.30 × 1010 cells ml-1. The FLC application appeared to have a positive effect on the number of the fluorescent methanogens. However, no significant effect on the morphology was found.},

Strain RMAS(T) grew solely on H(2)/CO(2) but required Casamino acids, tryptone, yeast extract or vitamins for growth. Growth of strain RMAS(T) was stimulated by acetate. Cells were non-motile, straight rods (0.5×3.5-10.5 µm) and occurred singly or in pairs. Bundles of fimbriae occurred at both poles of cells and the cell wall was thick (approximately 21 nm, as revealed by ultrathin section electron microscopy). Strain RMAS(T) grew at 45-80 °C (optimum, 70 °C), at pH 5.8-8.7 (optimum, pH 6.9-7.7) and with 0.001-20 g NaCl l(-1) (optimum, 2.5 g NaCl l(-1)). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus $\Delta$H(T) was most closely related to the isolate (95.7 {\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). On the basis of morphological, phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, it is clear that strain RMAS(T) represents a novel species of the genus Methanothermobacter, for which we propose the name Methanothermobacter tenebrarum sp. nov. The type strain is RMAS(T) ( = DSM 23052(T) = JCM 16532(T) = NBRC 106236(T)).},

Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA data for 30 strains belonging to the order Methanobacteriales strongly suggested that mesophilic and thermophilic Methanobacterium isolates are distantly related and should be assigned to separate genera. For the thermophilic strains the genus Methanothermobacter was initially proposed by Boone, Whitman and Rouvi{\`{e}}re. Furthermore, the results support a reclassification of 15 isolates in three species within the proposed genus: (i) Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus comb. nov., containing eight isolates, six of which are able to utilize formate (type strain deltaHT); (ii) Methanothermobacter wolfeii comb. nov., containing four formate-utilizing isolates (type strain DSM 2970T); (iii) Methanothermobacter marburgensis sp. nov., containing three obligately autotrophic isolates (type strain MarburgT).

abstract = {It is in the interest of operators of anaerobic digestion plants to maximise methane production whilst concomitantly reducing the chemical oxygen demand of the digested material. Although the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion is not a new idea, commercial anaerobic digestion processes are often operated at well below their optimal performance due to a variety of factors. This paper reviews current optimisation techniques associated with anaerobic digestion and suggests possible areas where improvements could be made, including the basic design considerations of a single or multi-stage reactor configuration, the type, power and duration of the mixing regime and the retention of active microbial biomass within the reactor. Optimisation of environmental conditions within the digester such as temperature, pH, buffering capacity and fatty acid concentrations is also discussed. The methane-producing potential of various agriculturally sourced feedstocks has been examined, as has the advantages of co-digestion to improve carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and the use of pre-treatments and additives to improve hydrolysis rates or supplement essential nutrients which may be limiting. However, perhaps the greatest shortfall in biogas production is the lack of reliable sensory equipment to monitor key parameters and suitable, parallelised control systems to ensure that the process continually operates at optimal performance. Modern techniques such as software sensors and powerful, flexible controllers are capable of solving these problems. A direct comparison can be made here with, for instance, oil refineries where a more mature technology uses continuous in situ monitoring and associated feedback procedures to routinely deliver continuous, optimal performance.},

abstract = {The pathway of propionate conversion in a syntrophic coculture of Smithella propionica and Methanospirillum hungatei JF1 was investigated by 13C-NMR spectroscopy. Cocultures produced acetate and butyrate from propionate. [3-13C]propionate was converted to [2-13C]acetate, with no [1-13C]acetate formed. Butyrate from [3-13C]propionate was labeled at the C2 and C4 positions in a ratio of about 1:1.5. Double-labeled propionate (2,3-13C) yielded not only double-labeled acetate but also single-labeled acetate at the C1 or C2 position. Most butyrate formed from [2,3-13C]propionate was also double labeled in either the C1 and C2 atoms or the C3 and C4 atoms in a ratio of about 1:1.5. Smaller amounts of single-labeled butyrate and other combinations were also produced. 1-13C-labeled propionate yielded both [1-13C]acetate and [2-13C]acetate. When 13C-labeled bicarbonate was present, label was not incorporated into acetate, propionate, or butyrate. In each of the incubations described above, 13C was never recovered in bicarbonate or methane. These results indicate that S. propionica does not degrade propionate via the methyl-malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) pathway or any other of the known pathways, such as the acryloyl-CoA pathway or the reductive carboxylation pathway. Our results strongly suggest that propionate is dismutated to acetate and butyrate via a six-carbon intermediate.},

abstract = {In the present study, thermophilic anaerobic digestion of wheat straw stillage was investigated. Methane potential of stillage was determined in batch experiments at two different substrate concentrations. Results showed that higher methane yields of 324 ml/g-(volatile solids) VSadded were obtained at stillage concentrations of 12.8 g-VS/L than at 25.6 g-VS/l. Continuous anaerobic digestion of stillage was performed in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor at 55 {\^{A}}°C with 2 days hydraulic retention time. Results showed that both substrate concentration and organic loading rate (OLR) influenced process performance and methane yields. Maximum methane yield of 155 ml CH4/g-COD was obtained at stillage mixtures with water of 25{\%} (v/v) in the feed and at an OLR of 17.1 g-COD/(l.d). Soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) removal at this OLR was 76{\%} (w/w). Increase in OLR to 41.2 g-COD/(l.d) and/or stillage concentration in the feed to 33{\^{a}}€“50{\%} (v/v) resulted in low methane yields or complete process failure. The results showed that thermophilic anaerobic digestion of wheat straw stillage alone for methane production is feasible in UASB reactor at an OLR of 17.1 g-COD/(l.d) and at substrate concentration of 25{\%} in the feed. The produced methane could improve the process energy and economics of a bioethanol plant and also enable to utilize the stillage in a sustainable manner.},

The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was 88.2{\%} with a CH(4) yield of 0.25L/(g COD(removed)) when organic loading rate (OLR) was 5.4kg CODm(-3)d(-1). C1 played the most important role in solvents (acetone, butanol and ethanol) and COD removal. Community structure of C2 was similar to that in C1 at stage 3 with higher OLR, but was similar to those in C3 and C4 at stages 1-2 with lower OLR. This community variation in C2 was consistent with its increased role in COD and solvent removal at stage 3. During community succession from C1 to C4 at stage 3, abundance of Firmicutes (especially OTUs ABRB07 and ABRB10) and Methanoculleus decreased, while Bacteroidetes and Methanocorpusculum became dominant. Thus, ABRB07 coupled with Methanoculleus and/or acetogen (ABRB10) may be key species for solvents degradation.},

Characterization of a strain, E1-9c(T), associated with uncultured group E1, from a minerotrophic fen is reported. Cells were regular cocci, usually found in pairs, that stained Gram-positive and were resistant to lysis by 0.1 {\%} SDS. Multiple flagella were observed, but motility was not observed in wet mounts. Optimal growth was obtained at moderate temperatures (28-30 degrees C) and slightly acidic pH (5.5). Total Na(+) and NaCl were only tolerated at concentrations less than 100 mM and 0.5 {\%}, respectively, and Na(2)S concentrations above 0.1 mM were inhibitory. H(2)/CO(2) and formate were the only methanogenic substrates used by E1-9c(T); formate concentrations above 50 mM were inhibitory for growth. Vitamins, coenzyme M and acetate (4 mM) were required for growth and the doubling time was about 19 h. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and inferred McrA amino acid sequences showed that E1-9c(T) represented an independent lineage within the order Methanomicrobiales. Physiological and phylogenetic comparisons with different members of the order supported classification of E1-9c(T) in a new genus in the Methanomicrobiales. The name Methanosphaerula palustris gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed; strain E1-9c(T) (=ATCC BAA-1565(T) =DSM 19958(T)) is the type strain of Methanosphaerula palustris.},

Up to this point, specific biogas production (L/kg VSin) remained roughly unchanged at the various whey fractions added in the feed mixture, mainly due to the lower chemical oxygen demand (COD) of whey compared to that of manure. At whey fractions above 50{\%}, the reactor turned to be unstable, as shown by the considerable decrease in pH and biogas production. The experiments were scaled up to a continuously stirred pilot tank reactor, which had previously been acclimated to poultry manure digestion. Whey was gradually introduced in the feed, at increasing rates, replacing equivalent volumes of manure, in such a way, that total COD of the feed remained constant. For an hydraulic retention time of 18 days at 35 °C and organic loading rate of 4.9 g COD/LR d, it was found that biogas production increased from 1.5 to 2.2 L/LR d (almost 40{\%}). This could be mainly attributed to the higher biodegradability of carbohydrates (main constituent of whey) compared to lipids (main constituent of manure) and to the correction (increase) of C:N ratio.},

abstract = {In the present study, thermophilic anaerobic digestion of wheat straw stillage was investigated. Methane potential of stillage was determined in batch experiments at two different substrate concentrations. Results showed that higher methane yields of 324 ml/g-(volatile solids) VSadded were obtained at stillage concentrations of 12.8 g-VS/L than at 25.6 g-VS/l. Continuous anaerobic digestion of stillage was performed in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor at 55 {\^{A}}°C with 2 days hydraulic retention time. Results showed that both substrate concentration and organic loading rate (OLR) influenced process performance and methane yields. Maximum methane yield of 155 ml CH4/g-COD was obtained at stillage mixtures with water of 25{\%} (v/v) in the feed and at an OLR of 17.1 g-COD/(l.d). Soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) removal at this OLR was 76{\%} (w/w). Increase in OLR to 41.2 g-COD/(l.d) and/or stillage concentration in the feed to 33{\^{a}}€“50{\%} (v/v) resulted in low methane yields or complete process failure. The results showed that thermophilic anaerobic digestion of wheat straw stillage alone for methane production is feasible in UASB reactor at an OLR of 17.1 g-COD/(l.d) and at substrate concentration of 25{\%} in the feed. The produced methane could improve the process energy and economics of a bioethanol plant and also enable to utilize the stillage in a sustainable manner.},

abstract = {A novel acidiphilic, hydrogenotrophic methanogen, designated strain 6A8(T), was isolated from an acidic (pH 4.0-4.5) and ombrotrophic (rain-fed) bog located near Ithaca, NY, USA. Cultures were dimorphic, containing thin rods (0.2-0.3 $\mu$m in diameter and 0.8-3.0 $\mu$m long) and irregular cocci (0.2-0.8 $\mu$m in diameter). The culture utilized H(2)/CO(2) to produce methane but did not utilize formate, acetate, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, butanol or trimethylamine. Optimal growth conditions were near pH 5.1 and 35 °C. The culture grew in basal medium containing as little as 0.43 mM Na(+) and growth was inhibited completely by 50 mM NaCl. To our knowledge, strain 6A8(T) is one of the most acidiphilic (lowest pH optimum) and salt-sensitive methanogens in pure culture. Acetate, coenzyme M, vitamins and yeast extract were required for growth. It is proposed that a new genus and species be established for this organism, Methanoregula boonei gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Methanoregula boonei is 6A8(T) (=DSM 21154(T) =JCM 14090(T)).},

Exponential phase cultures grown with sodium acetate contained irregularly shaped cocci that aggregated in the early stationary phase and finally differentiated into communal cysts that released individual cocci when ruptured or transferred to fresh medium. The irregularly shaped cocci (1.9 +/- 0.2 mm in diameter) were gram negative and occurred singly or in pairs. Cells were nonmotile, but possessed a single fimbria-like structure. Micrographs of thin sections showed a monolayered cell wall approximately 10 nm thick that consisted of protein subunits. The cells in aggregates were separated by visible septation. The communal cysts contained several single cocci encased in a common envelope. An amorphous form of the communal cyst that had incomplete septation and internal membrane-like vesicles was also present in late exponential phase cultures. Sodium acetate, methanol, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine were substrates for growth and methanogenesis; H(2)-CO(2) (80:20) and sodium formate were not. The optimal growth temperature was 35 to 40 degrees C. The optimal pH range was 6.5 to 7.0. Both NaCl and Mg were required for growth, with maximum growth rates at 0.2 M NaCl and 0.05 M MgSO(4).

abstract = {A study of NIR as a tool for process monitoring of thermophilic anaerobic digestion boosted by glycerol has been carried out, aiming at developing simple and robust Process Analytical Technology modalities for on-line surveillance in full scale biogas plants. Three 5 L laboratory fermenters equipped with on-line NIR sensor and special sampling stations were used as a basis for chemometric multivariate calibration. NIR characterisation using Transflexive Embedded Near Infra-Red Sensor (TENIRS) equipment integrated into an external recurrent loop on the fermentation reactors, allows for representative sampling, of the highly heterogeneous fermentation bio slurries. Glycerol is an important by-product from the increasing European bio-diesel production. Glycerol addition can boost biogas yields, if not exceeding a limiting 5-7 g L-1 concentration inside the fermenter - further increase can cause strong imbalance in the anaerobic digestion process. A secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of addition of glycerol, in a spiking experiment which introduced increasing organic overloading as monitored by volatile fatty acids (VFA) levels. High correlation between on-line NIR determinations of glycerol and VFA contents has been documented. Chemometric regression models (PLS) between glycerol and NIR spectra needed no outlier removals and only one PLS-component was required. Test set validation resulted in excellent measures of prediction performance, precision: r2 = 0.96 and accuracy = 1.04, slope of predicted versus reference fitting. Similar prediction statistics for acetic acid, iso-butanoic acid and total VFA proves that process NIR spectroscopy is able to quantify all pertinent levels of both volatile fatty acids and glycerol.

It was found that the sludge supernatant could be replaced with yeast extract (1 g/liter), 6 mM bicarbonate-30{\%} CO(2), and trace metals, with a doubling time on methanol of 14 h. For growth on either methanol or acetate, yeast extract could be replaced with CaCl(2) . 2H(2)O (13.6 muM minimum) and the vitamin p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA, ca. 3 nM minimum), with a doubling time on methanol of 8 to 9 h. Filter-sterilized folic acid at 0.3 muM could not replace PABA. The antimetabolite sulfanilamide (20 mM) inhibited growth of and methanogenesis by Methanosarcina sp. strain TM-1, and this inhibition was reversed by the addition of 0.3 muM PABA. When a defined medium buffered with 20 mM N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid was used, it was shown that Methanosarcina sp. strain TM-1 required 6 mM bicarbonate-30{\%} CO(2) for optimal growth and methanogenesis from methanol. Cells growing on acetate were less dependent on bicarbonate-CO(2). When we used a defined medium in which the only organic compounds present were methanol or acetate, nitrilotriacetic acid (0.2 mM), and PABA, it was possible to limit batch cultures of Methanosarcina sp. strain TM-1 for nitrogen at NH(4) concentrations at or below 2.0 mM, in marked contrast with Methanosarcina barkeri 227, which fixes dinitrogen when grown under NH(4) limitation.},

abstract = {The unusual compound beta-aminoglutaric acid (beta-glutamate) has been identified by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in soluble extracts of marine methanogenic bacteria. We examined several methanogen species representing nine genera and found that beta-glutamate occurred in methanococci and two methanogenium strains (Methanogenium cariaci JR1 and "Methanogenium anulus" AN9). The presence of this compound in the methanococci examined was further restricted to thermophilic members of the genus Methanococcus, including Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus strains, Methanococcus jannaschii, and "Methanococcus igneus." The two Methanogenium strains examined were mesophiles. Studies using Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus showed that levels of beta-glutamate in cells of that species were not affected by variation in growth temperature (40 to 65 degrees C), NH4+ (2 to 80 mM), Mg2+ (10 to 50 mM), or K+ (2 to 10 mM) in the medium. In contrast, soluble pools of beta-glutamate and L-alpha-glutamate (the other major free amino acid in all the methanococci) were proportional to NaCl levels in the growth medium. This dependence of beta-glutamate and L-alpha-glutamate concentrations on salt levels in the medium suggests that they function as osmolytes in these cells.},

Identification of methanogenes was based on autofluorescence of F420 and F430 coenzymes. Initially, the number of cells in methanogenic biofilm, was 4,4 x 104 cm-2 (at 6 h colonization), then increased to 1 x 107 cm-2 (on day 27 of colonization).

abstract = {Fluorescence measurement of viable hybridoma cell cultures provides a convenient method for monitoring the progress of a batch culture. It is shown that cell concentration changes as low as 35,000 cells/ml during initial stages of growth can be measured reliably. This sensitivity, however, decreases to 2 × 106 cells/ml at cell concentration greater than 2 × 106 cells/ml. The culture fluorescence of hybridoma culture is a characteristic property of the cell and the medium used. Consequently, processes in which the medium composition and cell lines are invariant, a direct on-line estimate of viable cell count can be made using the method investigated in this paper.},

abstract = {A study of NIR as a tool for process monitoring of thermophilic anaerobic digestion boosted by glycerol has been carried out, aiming at developing simple and robust Process Analytical Technology modalities for on-line surveillance in full scale biogas plants. Three 5 L laboratory fermenters equipped with on-line NIR sensor and special sampling stations were used as a basis for chemometric multivariate calibration. NIR characterisation using Transflexive Embedded Near Infra-Red Sensor (TENIRS) equipment integrated into an external recurrent loop on the fermentation reactors, allows for representative sampling, of the highly heterogeneous fermentation bio slurries. Glycerol is an important by-product from the increasing European bio-diesel production. Glycerol addition can boost biogas yields, if not exceeding a limiting 5-7 g L-1 concentration inside the fermenter - further increase can cause strong imbalance in the anaerobic digestion process. A secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of addition of glycerol, in a spiking experiment which introduced increasing organic overloading as monitored by volatile fatty acids (VFA) levels. High correlation between on-line NIR determinations of glycerol and VFA contents has been documented. Chemometric regression models (PLS) between glycerol and NIR spectra needed no outlier removals and only one PLS-component was required. Test set validation resulted in excellent measures of prediction performance, precision: r2 = 0.96 and accuracy = 1.04, slope of predicted versus reference fitting. Similar prediction statistics for acetic acid, iso-butanoic acid and total VFA proves that process NIR spectroscopy is able to quantify all pertinent levels of both volatile fatty acids and glycerol.

abstract = {Biogas is produced by biological processes under anaerobic conditions and may contain up to 20,000 ppm(v) hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), a corrosive substance that attacks power engines and can affect the health of the industrial staff. H(2)S must be removed from the biogas, especially in co-generation facilities where the biogas is burnt for energy production. Nowadays, biofiltration is being studied and considered as an interesting alternative for removing H(2)S from the biogas besides classical chemical processes. The novelty of this work is the design and construction of an automated H(2)S on-line analyser to assess the composition of the liquid and gas phases of gas-phase bioreactors. The analyser is made of two parallel flow configurations which share the same detection device. The first configuration is a single-channel flow injection analyser (FIA) to detect S(2-) in the liquid phase. The second configuration is a continuous flow analyser (CFA) with a gaseous diffusion step (GD-CFA) for detecting H(2)S in the gas phase. The diffusion step enables separation of the H(2)S((g)) from the sample and its conversion into a detectable chemical species (S(2-)). S(2-) detection was performed with an Ag(2)S ion-selective electrode (ISE) selective to S(2-)(aq). The main response parameters of the FIA system are a linear range between 3 x 10(-5) and 1 x 10(-1) mol L(-1) S(2-) (0.61-3,200 mg L(-1)), with a sensitivity of 27.9 mV decade(-1) and a detection limit of 1.93 x 10(-5) mol L(-1) S(2-). The GD-CFA configuration presents a linear range between 400 and 10,000 ppm(v) H(2)S((g)) with a sensitivity of 26.1 mV decade(-1) and a detection limit of 245 ppm(v) H(2)S. The proposed analyser was used by analysing real gas and liquid samples with optimal results at a full-scale biotrickling filter for biogas treatment at a municipal wastewater treatment plant.},

abstract = {The simultaneous determination of betaine (trimethyl-glycine), N,N-dimethylglycine (N,N-DMG), acetic, and propionic acid in complex organic matrices for process monitoring is described. In some cases also ammonia and chloride were detected. The determinations were carried out by means of isocratic cation-exchange chromatography. For the detection of betain and N,N-DMG an ultraviolet detector was used. All other substances were detected by conductivity. Linear calibration curves were obtained for betaine (0.01–7.71 g/l), both organic acids (0.06–60 mM), chloride (0.01–4.31 g/l), and ammonia (0.05–1.02 g/l) over the concentration range given in parentheses. The results obtained by HPLC were checked by gas-chromatographic (GC) measurements for the organic acids and by photometric tests for betaine and ammonia. The values for the organic acids obtained by HPLC and GC varied only in the range of the statistical deviation of the two methods. A larger discrepancy was observed for betaine. The values obtained after precipitation of betaine as a reineckate were up to 60{\%} higher than those of the HPLC measurements. The results of the two methods were the same if the samples were filtered through a microporous membrane with a cut-off of 20 kDa. The applicability of the HPLC method for on-line process monitoring was shown in the context of an experiment being run for 40 h.},

abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/bit.260391112.abs On-line in situ fluorescence measurements of the methanogenic fermentation were conducted with reactors receiving either glucose or a mixture of volatile fatty acids as the substrate. The reactors were perturbed from steady-state conditions in order to assess the response of fluorescencemonitoring probes. Two fluorescence-monitoring probes were evaluated over a period of 8 months; they performed in a consistent manner, and their response was not significantly affected by the changes in pH and redox potential encountered during routine reactor operation. A commercially available probe, designed to measure NAD(P)H, demonstrated particular promise for detecting imbalance caused by the entry of air, inhibitor addition and was capable of distinguishing between different substrates. This fluorescence-monitoring probe detected imbalance more rapidly than other on-line measurements such as pH, Eh, or gas production, or off-line measurements such as volatile fatty acid concentration or gas composition. An experimental fluorescence-monitoring probe, designed to measure coenzyme F420, also showed some promise in this regard. The response of the fluorescence-monitoring probes also revealed details of the metabolic routes in the reactors and the probes represent a useful research tool. For example, a failure to observe the characteristic response of the NAD(P)H-monitoring probe to formate addition during the metabolism of acetate, propionate, or glucose strongly suggests that any formate liberated during their catabolism is degraded via a different route to exogenously added formate.},

Criteria necessary for a scale-up design of the biofilter were established and the sulfur balances at various loadings were tabulated. High and satisfactory H2S removal efficiency levels were maintained during operation and the optimal retention time was found to be 28 s corresponding to a H2S removal efficiency greater than 98{\%}. The pH drop was insignificant in this biofilter. The optimal inlet S-loading can be noted as 25 g m-3 h-1 that is at the upper end of linear correlation between inlet loading and removal capacity. We suggest that the Thiobacillus thioparus CH11 immobilized with Ca-alginate is a potent method to control hydrogen sulfide emissions.},

abstract = {The nitrogen cycle (N-cycle) in the biosphere, mainly driven by prokaryotes, involves different reductive or oxidative reactions used either for assimilatory purposes or in respiratory processes for energy conservation. As the N-cycle has important agricultural and environmental implications, bacterial nitrogen metabolism has become a major research topic in recent years. Archaea are able to perform different reductive pathways of the N-cycle, including both assimilatory processes, such as nitrate assimilation and N(2) fixation, and dissimilatory reactions, such as nitrate respiration and denitrification. However, nitrogen metabolism is much less known in archaea than in bacteria. The availability of the complete genome sequences of several members of the eury- and crenarchaeota has enabled new approaches to the understanding of archaeal physiology and biochemistry, including metabolic reactions involving nitrogen compounds. Comparative studies reveal that significant differences exist in the structure and regulation of some enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism in archaea, giving rise to important conclusions and new perspectives regarding the evolution, function and physiological relevance of the different N-cycle processes. This review discusses the advances that have been made in understanding nitrate reduction and other aspects of the inorganic nitrogen metabolism in archaea.},

To understand this microbial diversity and dynamics, 16S rRNA-gene-targeted denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting was conducted at two different taxonomic levels: the domain and order levels. The DGGE profiles of the domain Archaea and the three orders Methanosarcinales, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanobacteriales were comparatively analyzed after each DGGE band was sequenced to enable identification. The DGGE profiles of the three orders showed methanogens belonging to each order that were not detected in the DGGE profile of the Archaea. This discrepancy may have resulted from PCR bias or differences in the abundances of the three microbial orders in the anaerobic bioreactor. In conclusion, to fully understand the detailed methanogenic diversity and dynamics in an anaerobic bioreactor, it is necessary to conduct DGGE analysis with 16S rRNA gene primers that target lower taxonomic groups.},

abstract = {A granular activated carbon (GAC) anaerobic fluidised-bed reactor treating vinasse from an ethanol distillery of sugar beet molasses was operated for 90 days, the first 40 days of start-up followed by 50 days of operation at constant organic loading rate of 1.7 g COD/Ld . The reactor showed good performance in terms of organic matter removal but an anomalous behaviour in terms of unusual high concentrations of molecular nitrogen in the biogas. The analysis of the different nitrogenous and sulphur compounds and the mass balances of these compounds in the liquid and gas phases clearly indicated an uncommon evolution of nitrogen and sulphur in the reactor. About 50{\%} of the nitrogen entering the reactor as total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) was removed from the liquid phase appearing as N2 in the gas phase. Simultaneously, only 20{\%} of the S-SO42- initially present in the influent appears as S-S2-in the effluent or S-H2S in the biogas, indicating that 80{\%} of the sulphur is removed. This behaviour has not been reported previously in the literature. These observations may suggest a new anaerobic removal process of ammonia and sulphate according to an uncommon mechanism involving simultaneous anaerobic ammonium oxidation and sulphate reduction.},

abstract = {Neutral fat hydrolysis and long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) oxidation rates were determined during the digestion of slaughterhouse wastewater in anaerobic sequencing batch reactors operated at 25°C. The experimental substrate consisted of filtered slaughterhouse wastewater supplemented with pork fat particles at various average initial sizes (Din) ranging from 60 to 450 {\&}mgr;m. At the Din tested, there was no significant particle size effect on the first-order hydrolysis rate. The neutral fat hydrolysis rate averaged 0.63 ± 0.07 d-1. LCFA oxidation rate was modelled using a Monod-type equation. The maximum substrate utilization rate (kmax) and the half-saturation concentration (Ks) averaged 164 ± 37 mg LCFA/L/d and 35 ± 31 mg LCFA/L, respectively. Pork fat particle degradation was mainly controlled by LCFA oxidation rate and, to a lesser extent, by neutral fat hydrolysis rate. Hydrolysis pretreatment of fat-containing wastewaters and sludges should not substantially accelerate their anaerobic treatment. At a Din of 450 {\&}mgr;m, fat particles were found to inhibit methane production during the initial 20 h of digestion. Inhibition of methane production in the early phase of digestion was the only significant effect of fat particle size on anaerobic digestion of pork slaughterhouse wastewater. Soluble COD could not be used to determine the rate of lipid hydrolysis due to LCFA adsorption on the biomass. {\textcopyright} 2002 Government of Canada.

The system uses sealed tubes that contain a gas mixture of 80{\%} hydrogen and 20{\%} carbon dioxide under a pressure of 2 to 3 atm. This modification of the Hungate technique reduces variability among replicate cultures and simplifies the dispensing, sterilization, and storage of liquid media as well as the transfer and maintenance of methanogenic bacteria. Results indicate a limit of sensitivity of the assay at 5 nM HS-CoM, with half-maximal growth at 25 nM HS-CoM. Coenzyme activity could be replaced by 2,2'-dithiodiethanesulfonic acid at a half-molar equivalent of the HS-CoM concentration, or by 2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonic acid on an equimolar basis. These data reveal a very sensitive and precise requirement for HS-CoM in the nutrition of this fastidious anaerobe.},

One of the crucial steps is oxidation of organic acids, with electron transfer via hydrogen or formate from acetogenic bacteria to methanogens. This syntrophic microbiological process is strongly restricted by a thermodynamic limitation on the allowable hydrogen or formate concentration. In order to study this process in more detail, we developed an individual-based biofilm model which enables to describe the processes at a microbial resolution. The biochemical model is the ADM1, implemented in a multidimensional domain. With this model, we evaluated three important issues for the syntrophic relationship: (i) Is there a fundamental difference in using hydrogen or formate as electron carrier? (ii) Does a thermodynamic-based inhibition function produced substantially different results from an empirical function? and; (iii) Does the physical co-location of acetogens and methanogens follow directly from a general model.

abstract = {Simple logic control algorithms were tested for automatic control of a lab-scale CSTR manure digester. Using an online VFA monitoring system, propionate concentration in the reactor was used as parameter for control of the biogas process. The propionate concentration was kept below a threshold of 10 mM by manipulating the feed flow. Other online parameters such as pH, biogas production, total VFA, and other individual VFA were also measured to examine process performance. The experimental results showed that a simple logic control can successfully prevent the reactor from overload, but with fluctuations of the propionate level due to the nature of control approach. The fluctuation of propionate concentration could be reduced, by adding a lower feed flow limit into the control algorithm to prevent undershooting of propionate response. It was found that use of the biogas production as a main control parameter, rather than propionate can give a more stable process, since propionate was very persistent and only responded very slowly to the decrease of the feed flow which lead to high fluctuation of biogas production. Propionate, however, was still an excellent parameter to indicate process stress under gradual overload and thus recommended as an alarm in the control algorithm.},

Methanocorpusculum strains are weakly motile and form irregularly coccoid cells, about 1 gm in diameter. The cell envelope consists of a cytoplasmic membrane and a S-layer, composed of hexagonally arranged glycoprotein subunits with molecular weights of 90000 (Methanocorpusculum parvurn), 92000 (M. sinense), and 94000 (M. bavaricurn). The center-to-center spacings are 14.3 nm, 15.8 nm and 16.0 nm, respectively. Optimal growth of strains is obtained in the mesophilic temperature range and at a pH around 7. Methane is produced from H2/CO2, formate, 2-propanol/CO2 and 2-butanol/COz by M. parvurn and M. bavaricum, whereas M. sinense can only utilize Hz/ CO2 and formate. Growth of M. sinense and M. bavaricum is dependent on the presence of clarified rumen fluid. The G + C content of the DNA of the three strains is ranging from 47.7- 53.6 mol{\%} as determined by different methods. A similar, but distinct polar lipid pattern indicates a close relationship between the three Methanocorpusculum species. The polyamine patterns of M. parvurn, M. sinense and M. bavaricum are similar, but distinct from those of other methanogens and are characterized by a high concentration of the otherwise rare 1,3-diaminopropane. Quantitative comparison of the antigenic fingerprint of members of Methanocorpusculum revealed no antigenic relationship with any one of the reference methanogens tested. On the basis of the distant phylogenetic position of M. parvum and the data presented in this paper a new family, the Methanocorpusculaceae faro. nov., is defined.},

Analysis of the cellular proteins and 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these three strains represented a single novel species that formed a deep branch of the mesophilic methanococci. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the three strains were most closely related to Methanothermococcus okinawensis (95 {\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). However, strains PL-15/H(P), Nankai-2 and Nankai-3(T) grew at temperatures that were more similar to those of recognized species within the genus Methanococcus. Strain Nankai-3(T) grew fastest at 46 degrees C. Results of physiological and biochemical tests allowed the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strains PL-15/H(P), Nankai-2 and Nankai-3(T) from closely related species.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 75.8{\%} of the rpoB clones were associated with beta-Proteobacteria while the remaining 24.2{\%} were with gamma-Proteobacteria. All phylotypes showed close similarity to previously reported cultivable lineages from metal or organic contaminant-rich environments. In an archaeal 16S rRNA gene library, 70{\%} of the clones were affiliated to Crenarchaeota, while 30{\%} belonged to Euryarchaeota. Most of the Euryarchaeota sequences were related to acetoclastic lineages belonging to Methanosarcinales. A single phylotype within the Euryarchaeota showed no association with cultivable euryarchaeotal lineages and might represent novel taxon. Diversity indices demonstrated greater diversity of Bacteria compared to Archaea in CdAR sediments. Sediment characterization by the X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy revealed high amount of toxic metals.

The cells stained gram-negative, were 1.0-2.0 microm in diameter, were lysed by SDS and hypotonic solutions and were flagellated. Motility was not observed. The strain was able to use H2/CO2, 2-propanol/CO2, formate, 2-butanol/CO2 and cyclopentanol/CO2 as substrates for methanogenesis, but did not utilize acetate, ethanol, methanol or methylamines. The optimum temperature and pH were 25-30 degrees C and 6.7-7.2. Analysis of lipid component parts (core lipids, phospholipid polar head groups and glycolipid sugar moieties) showed the characteristic pattern of members of the family Methanomicrobiaceae except for the absence of glucose as a glycolipid sugar moiety. The G+C content of the DNA was 62.2 mol {\%}. Sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA revealed that the strain belonged to the genus Methanoculleus. The strain had DNA-DNA hybridization values of less than 50{\%} with type strains of Methanoculleus species. On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, the name Methanoculleus chikugoensis sp. nov. is proposed for strain MG62T (= JCM 10825T = DSM 13459T). The DNA hybridization study also revealed the close relationships of three species, Methanoculleus olentangyi, Methanoculleus bourgensis and Methanoculleus oldenburgensis, among Methanoculleus species.},

abstract = {A novel hydrogenotrophic methanogen, designated strain MRE50(T), was isolated from a methanogenic consortium, which was originally established from an Italian rice field soil. Cells were non-motile rods, 1.3-2.8 $\mu$m long and 0.4-0.7 $\mu$m wide. Coccoid cells were also observed in cultures at the late-exponential phase of growth. Strain MRE50(T) grew at 37-55 °C (optimally at 45 °C), at pH 6-7.8 (optimally at pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0-20 g NaCl l(-1). The isolate utilized H(2)/CO(2) and formate for growth and methane production. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene and the methanogen-specific marker gene mcrA showed that strain MRE50(T) is affiliated with the order Methanocellales, previously known as uncultured archaeal group Rice Cluster I. Based on both 16S rRNA gene and mcrA gene sequences, strain MRE50(T) was related most closely to Methanocella paludicola SANAE(T). Levels of sequence similarity were 92.5 and 86.1 {\%}, respectively, indicating that strains MRE50(T) and Methanocella paludicola SANAE(T) represent different species within the genus Methanocella. In addition, although these strains shared phenotypic properties including cell morphology and substrate utilization, they differed with respect to susceptibility to antibiotics, and temperature and NaCl ranges for growth. Given the phenotypic differences and the distinct phylogenetic placement of the new isolate relative to the type species of the genus Methanocella, strain MRE50(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Methanocella, for which the name Methanocella arvoryzae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MRE50(T) (=NBRC 105507(T) =DSM 22066(T)).},

abstract = {Calculations of the kinetics of volatile fatty acids removal in an anaerobic filter showed that methane production from n-butyrate was not consistent with [beta]-oxidation when the reactor was operated under sequential feeding conditions. Under these conditions, n-butyrate might be anaerobically catabolised by decarboxylation. Iso-butyrate was formed at about 25{\%} of the total amount of n-butyrate removed. After 13 days of continuous feeding, the material balance was consistent with the [beta]-oxidation mechanism and the formation of iso-butyrate became negligible. N-butyrate decarboxylation may therefore be a transient catabolic pathway, although the reason why decarboxylation is preferred to [beta]-oxidation under conditions such as sequential feeding is not clear. Results of similar experiments on acetate removal were consistent with theoretical expectations under conditions of both sequential and continous feeding.},

abstract = {An autotrophic, hyperthermophilic methanogen (M7T) was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal chimney sample collected on the East Pacific Rise at a depth of 2600 m. The coccoid-shaped cells are flagellated and exhibit a slight tumbling motility. The temperature range for growth at pH 6.5 was 49-89 degrees C, with optimum growth at 80 degrees C. The optimum pH for growth was 6.5, and the optimum NaCl concentration for growth was around 25 g l-1. The new isolate used H2 and CO2 as the only substrates for growth and methane production. Tungsten, selenium and yeast extract stimulated growth significantly. In the presence of CO2 and H2, the organism reduced elemental sulphur to hydrogen sulphide. Growth was inhibited by chloramphenicol and rifampicin, but not by ampicillin, kanamycin, penicillin and streptomycin. The G + C content of the genomic DNA was 31 mol{\%}. As determined by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, this organism was closely related to Methanococcus jannaschii strain JAL-1T. However, despite the high percentage of similarity between their 16S rDNA sequences (97.1{\%}), the DNA-DNA hybridization levels between these strains were less than 5{\%}. On the basis of these observations and physiological traits, it is proposed that this organism should be placed in a new species, Methanococcus vulcanius. The type strain is M7T (= DSM 12094T). During the course of this study, the 16S rDNA sequence analysis placed Methanococcus sp. strain AG86T (= DSM 4213T) as a close relative of M. jannaschii strain JAL-1T. However, the weak level of DNA-DNA hybridization with this strain ({\textless} 10{\%}) allowed the proposal that strain AG86T also constitutes a new species, Methanococcus fervens.},

abstract = {Anaerobic bioreactors that can support simultaneous microbial processes of denitrification and methanogenesis are of interest to nutrient nitrogen removal. However, an important concern is the potential toxicity of nitrate (NO(3) (-)) and nitrite (NO(2) (-)) to methanogenesis. The methanogenic toxicity of the NO (x) (-) compounds to anaerobic granular biofilms and municipal anaerobic digested sludge with two types of substrates, acetate and hydrogen, was studied. The inhibition was the severest when the NO (x) (-) compounds were still present in the media (exposure period). During this period, 95{\%} or greater inhibition of methanogenesis was evident at the lowest concentrations of added NO(2) (-) tested (7.6-10.2 mg NO(2) (-)-N l(-1)) or 8.3-121 mg NO(3) (-)-N l(-1) of added NO(3) (-), depending on substrate and inoculum source. The inhibition imparted by NO(3) (-) was not due directly to NO(3) (-) itself, but instead due to reduced intermediates (e.g., NO(2) (-)) formed during the denitrification process. The toxicity of NO (x) (-) was found to be reversible after the exposure period. The recovery of activity was nearly complete at low added NO (x) (-) concentrations; whereas the recovery was only partial at high added NO (x) (-) concentrations. The recovery is attributed to the metabolism of the NO (x) (-) compounds. The assay substrate had a large impact on the rate of NO(2) (-) metabolism. Hydrogen reduced NO(2) (-) slowly such that NO(2) (-) accumulated more and as a result, the toxicity was greater compared to acetate as a substrate. The final methane yield was inversely proportional to the amount of NO (x) (-) compounds added indicating that they were the preferred electron acceptors compared to methanogenesis.},

Using 16S rRNA and functional genes, we investigated the diversity of methanogens in the sediments of Lonar Lake, a unique saline and alkaline ecosystem formed by meteorite impact in the Deccan basalts. Although domain and phylum level 16S rRNA gene libraries were dominated by phylotypes related to Halobacteriales, sequences related to potentially novel Archaea within the orders Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales were obtained together with a significant fraction of sequences representing uncultivated Euryarchaeota [Correction added after online publication 16 April 2012: orders 'Methanosarcina and Methanomicrobiaceae' changed to 'Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales']. To identify the active methylotrophic Archaea involved in methanogenesis, mRNA transcripts of mcrA were retrieved from methanol consuming and methane emitting sediment microcosms at two different time points. Reverse-transcription PCR, qPCR, DGGE fingerprint, and clone library analysis showed that the active Archaea were closely related to Methanolobus oregonensis. To our knowledge, this is the first study identifying active methylotrophic methanogens in such an environment.},

The experimental substrate consisted of filtered slaughterhouse wastewater supplemented with pork fat particles at various average initial sizes (Din) ranging from 60 to 450 {\&}mgr;m. At the Din tested, there was no significant particle size effect on the first-order hydrolysis rate. The neutral fat hydrolysis rate averaged 0.63 ± 0.07 d-1. LCFA oxidation rate was modelled using a Monod-type equation. The maximum substrate utilization rate (kmax) and the half-saturation concentration (Ks) averaged 164 ± 37 mg LCFA/L/d and 35 ± 31 mg LCFA/L, respectively. Pork fat particle degradation was mainly controlled by LCFA oxidation rate and, to a lesser extent, by neutral fat hydrolysis rate. Hydrolysis pretreatment of fat-containing wastewaters and sludges should not substantially accelerate their anaerobic treatment. At a Din of 450 {\&}mgr;m, fat particles were found to inhibit methane production during the initial 20 h of digestion. Inhibition of methane production in the early phase of digestion was the only significant effect of fat particle size on anaerobic digestion of pork slaughterhouse wastewater. Soluble COD could not be used to determine the rate of lipid hydrolysis due to LCFA adsorption on the biomass. {\textcopyright} 2002 Government of Canada.

The reactor performance was determined in terms of methane production, volatile fatty acids conversion and chemical oxygen demand reduction. At a constant influent strength, the methane production rate (litres CH4g-1 COD day-1) decreased with decreasing hydraulic retention time. At constant hydraulic retention time the methane production rate increased as the influent strength was increased up to a concentration of 28{\textperiodcentered}8 g COD litre-1. The methane production rate was similar for two influent concentrations studied at hydraulic retention times longer than 10 days. The effect of short hydraulic retention times on methane production rate was more pronounced for the higher influent concentration than for the lower influent concentration. The highest methane production rate of 9{\textperiodcentered}57 litres CH4 litre-1 feed day-1 was obtained at a loading rate of 5{\textperiodcentered}96 g-1 COD litre-1 and an influent concentration of 28{\textperiodcentered}8 g COD litre-1. A high treatment efficiency in terms of chemical oxygen demand reduction was obtained. In general, over 98{\%} removal of chemical oxygen demand was achieved. The results indicated that anaerobic digestion of cheese whey using an up-flow sludge blanket reactor could reduce pollution strength and produce energy for a cheese plant.},

Characterisation of the system indicated that influent was a combination of equal parts (in terms of COD) particulate fat, particulate protein, and soluble protein. Reactor hydraulics were close to completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) hydraulics, as indicated by a residence time distribution (RTD) study. The Monday morning abattoir start-up was identified as a key disturbance suitable for parameter estimation. A stepwise parameter estimation procedure was used as proposed in the previous paper. An experimental data set without recycle was used for parameter estimation. The model with these parameters performed well on independent data sets with and without recycle.

abstract = {The intermediary carbon and electron flow routes for lactose degradation during whey biomethanation were studied in continuous culture. The chemostat was operated under lactose-limited conditions with a 100-h retention time. The carbon balance observed for lactose degradation was 4.65 mmol of CH4, 4.36 mmol of CO2 and 1.15 mmol of cellular carbon per mmol of lactose consumed, with other intermediary metabolites (i.e., acetate, lactate, etc.) accounting for less than 2{\%} of the lactose consumed. The carbon and electron recoveries for this biomethanation were 87 and 90{\%}, respectively. 14C tracer studies demonstrated that lactose biomethanation occurred in three distinct but simultaneous phases. Lactose was metabolized primarily into lactate, ethanol, acetate, formate, and carbon dioxide. During this hydrolytic phase, 82{\%} of the lactose was transformed into lactate. These metabolites were transformed into acetate and H2-CO2 in a second, acetogenic, phase. Finally, the direct methane precursors were transformed during the methanogenic phase, with acetate accounting for 81{\%} of the methane formed. A general scheme is proposed for the exact carbon and electron flow route during lactose biomethanation, which predicts the prevalent microbial populations in this ecosystem.},

abstract = {Anaerobic digestion disintegration and hydrolysis have been traditionally modeled according to first-order kinetics assuming that their rates do not depend on disintegration/hydrolytic biomass concentrations. However, the typical sigmoid-shape increase in time of the disintegration/hydrolysis rates cannot be described with first-order models. For complex substrates, first-order kinetics should thus be modified to account for slowly degradable material. In this study, a slightly modified IWA ADM1 model is presented to simulate thermophilic anaerobic digestion of thermally pretreated waste activated sludge. Contois model is first included for disintegration and hydrolysis steps instead of first-order kinetics and Hill function is then used to model ammonia inhibition of aceticlastic methanogens instead of a non-competitive function. One batch experimental data set of anaerobic degradation of a raw waste activated sludge is used to calibrate the proposed model and three additional data sets from similar sludge thermally pretreated at three different temperatures are used to validate the parameters values.},

abstract = {Changes in lactose concentration and feed rate altered bacterial growth and population levels in a whey-processing chemostat. The bacterial population and methane production levels increased in relation to increased lactose concentrations comparable to those in raw whey (6{\%}) and converted over 96{\%} of the substrate to methane, carbon dioxide, and cells. Sequential increases in the chemostat dilution rate demonstrated excellent biomethanation performance at retention times as low as 25 h. Retention times shorter than 25 h caused prevalent bacterial populations and methane production to decrease, and intermediary carbon metabolites accumulated in the following order: acetate, butyrate, propionate, lactate, ethanol, and lactose. Bacterial species dominated in the chemostat as a function of their enhanced substrate uptake and growth kinetic properties. The substrate uptake kinetic properties displayed by the mixed chemostat population were equivalent to those of individual species measured in pure culture, whereas the growth kinetic properties of species in mixed culture were better than those measured in pure culture. A designed starter culture consisting of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Methanosarcina barkeri, and Methanobacterium formicicum displayed biomethanation performance, which was similar to that of a diverse adapted mixed-culture inoculum, in a continuous contact digestor system to which 10 g of dry whey per liter was added. Preserved starter cultures were developed and used as inocula for the start-up of a continuous anaerobic digestion process that was effective for biomethanation of raw whey at a retention time of 100 h.},

abstract = {Four formate-utilizing methanogens were isolated from ovine (strain KM1H5-1P(T)) and bovine (strains AK-87, OCP and ZA-10(T)) rumen contents. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the methanogen strains were found to belong to the order Methanobacteriales in the genus Methanobrevibacter. Strains ZA-10(T) and KM1H5-1P(T) gained energy for growth by the reduction of CO(2) to CH(4) using H(2) or formate exclusively as electron donors. Increasing formate concentrations to 220 mM in batch cultures increased the growth of strain KM1H5-1P(T) but did not affect the growth of strain ZA-10(T). Substrate specificity and resistance to cell-wall lysis supported the affiliation of the strains to the genus Methanobrevibacter. Strains ZA-10(T) and KM1H5-1P(T) showed 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.0 and 98.6 {\%} to their closest recognized relatives, Methanobrevibacter thaueri CW(T) and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium M1(T), respectively. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments indicated that the strains were not affiliated at the species level to their closest recognized relatives, with DNA reassociation values of only 28 {\%} between strains ZA-10(T) and Methanobrevibacter thaueri CW(T) and {\textless}25 {\%} between strains KM1H5-1P(T) and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium M1(T). Based on the data presented, the new strains are considered to represent two novel species of the genus Methanobrevibacter, for which the names Methanobrevibacter millerae sp. nov.

abstract = {The isolation of a new methanogenic bacterium, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicus sp. n., is described. Successful isolation required a medium containing inorganic salts, an atmosphere consisting of an 80:20 mixture of hydrogen-carbon dioxide, and incubation temperatures of 65 to 70 C. Isolates of M. thermoautotrophicus were gram-positive, nonmotile, irregularly curved rods which frequently formed long filaments. The organism was found to be an autotroph and a strict anaerobe, and to have a pH optimum of 7.2 to 7.6. The optimal temperature for growth was 65 to 70 C, the maximum being 75 C and the minimum about 40 C. The generation time at the optimum was about 5 hr. The deoxyribonucleic acid of M. thermoautotrophicus had a guanine plus cytosine (GC) content of 52 moles per cent, whereas Methanobacterium sp. strain M.O.H. had a GC content of 38{\%}. When heated, intact ribosomes of Methanobacterium sp. strain M.O.H. were stable up to 55 C and had a Tm of 73 C. In contrast, ribosomes of M. thermoautotrophicus were stable up to 75 C and had a Tm of 82 C. Upon complete thermal denaturation, ribosomes of strain M.O.H. underwent a 59{\%} hyperchromic shift, whereas those of the thermophile showed only a 20{\%} increase in hyperchromicity. Methane formation in cell-free extracts of M. thermoautotrophicus was temperature-dependent and required hydrogen and carbon dioxide; methyl cobalamin served as a methyl donor, and addition of coenzyme M stimulated methanogenesis.},

Three dominant bacterial trophic group populations were present (in most probable number per milliliter) whose species numbers varied with the substrate consumed: hydrolytic, 1010; acetogenic, 107 to 1010; and methanogenic, 106 to 109. The three prevalent species utilizing lactose were identified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Clostridium butyricum. Clostridium propionicum and Desulfovibrio vulgaris were the dominant lactate-consuming, hydrogen-producing acetogenic bacteria, while D. vulgaris was the only significant ethanol-degrading species. Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanothrix soehngenii were identified as the dominant acetate-utilizing methanogens, and Methanobacterium formicicum was the prevalent hydrogen-utilizing methanogen. A microbial food chain is proposed for lactose biomethanation that comprises multiple species in three different groups, with the major hydrogen-producing acetogen being a sulfate-reducing species, D. vulgaris, which functioned in the absence of significant levels of environmental sulfate.},

Characterisation of the system indicated that influent was a combination of equal parts (in terms of COD) particulate fat, particulate protein, and soluble protein. Reactor hydraulics were close to completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) hydraulics, as indicated by a residence time distribution (RTD) study. The Monday morning abattoir start-up was identified as a key disturbance suitable for parameter estimation. A stepwise parameter estimation procedure was used as proposed in the previous paper.

abstract = {Anaerobic digestion disintegration and hydrolysis have been traditionally modeled according to first-order kinetics assuming that their rates do not depend on disintegration/hydrolytic biomass concentrations. However, the typical sigmoid-shape increase in time of the disintegration/hydrolysis rates cannot be described with first-order models. For complex substrates, first-order kinetics should thus be modified to account for slowly degradable material. In this study, a slightly modified IWA ADM1 model is presented to simulate thermophilic anaerobic digestion of thermally pretreated waste activated sludge. Contois model is first included for disintegration and hydrolysis steps instead of first-order kinetics and Hill function is then used to model ammonia inhibition of aceticlastic methanogens instead of a non-competitive function. One batch experimental data set of anaerobic degradation of a raw waste activated sludge is used to calibrate the proposed model and three additional data sets from similar sludge thermally pretreated at three different temperatures are used to validate the parameters values.},

The critical dilution rate of the chemostat, in which most of the introduced LCFA were decomposed and mineralized, was 0.4 d-1. The microbial community under steady-state condition at this dilution rate was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We detected the following major groups of methanogens within the archaeal community: the aceticlastic genera Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina and the hydrogenotrophic genus Methanospirillum. We also detected organisms that were closely related to fatty-acid oxidizing bacteria affiliated with the family Syntrophomonadaceae. However, bacteria belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes, which are phylogenetically distant from known fatty-acid oxidizing bacteria, apparently predominated in the population, indicating that they play important roles in LCFA degradation within the chemostat.},

abstract = {Changes in lactose concentration and feed rate altered bacterial growth and population levels in a whey-processing chemostat. The bacterial population and methane production levels increased in relation to increased lactose concentrations comparable to those in raw whey (6{\%}) and converted over 96{\%} of the substrate to methane, carbon dioxide, and cells. Sequential increases in the chemostat dilution rate demonstrated excellent biomethanation performance at retention times as low as 25 h. Retention times shorter than 25 h caused prevalent bacterial populations and methane production to decrease, and intermediary carbon metabolites accumulated in the following order: acetate, butyrate, propionate, lactate, ethanol, and lactose. Bacterial species dominated in the chemostat as a function of their enhanced substrate uptake and growth kinetic properties. The substrate uptake kinetic properties displayed by the mixed chemostat population were equivalent to those of individual species measured in pure culture, whereas the growth kinetic properties of species in mixed culture were better than those measured in pure culture. A designed starter culture consisting of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Methanosarcina barkeri, and Methanobacterium formicicum displayed biomethanation performance, which was similar to that of a diverse adapted mixed-culture inoculum, in a continuous contact digestor system to which 10 g of dry whey per liter was added. Preserved starter cultures were developed and used as inocula for the start-up of a continuous anaerobic digestion process that was effective for biomethanation of raw whey at a retention time of 100 h.},

High-rate anaerobic treatment of complex wastewater is becoming more popular due to economic and environmental advantages. However, treatment is complicated because of the high levels of solids and fats and lack of knowledge of degradation mechanisms. This paper is the {\textregistered}rst part of a study of a structural model describing degradation of complex wastewater. A structural anaerobic model is developed which extends previous research, of which the most recent described the anaerobic degradation of soluble protein (Ramsay, I.R., 1997. Modelling and Control of High-Rate Anaerobic Wastewater Treatment Systems. Ph.D. Thesis, Department of Chemical Engineering, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia). This study incorporates hydrolysis of particulates and long chain fatty acid (LCFA) b-oxidation. A set of physico-chemical equations describes gas transfer and ionic reactions and structured biochemical equations describe biological and enzymatic reactions. A generic parameter estimation methodology for application to full-scale systems is also proposed.},

Methane production, but not growth, occurred with CO2 in the presence of either 2-propanol, 2-butanol or cyclopentanol as hydrogen donors. The temperature range for growth was 25-50 degrees C, the optimum being between 37 and 42 degrees C. The optimum pH for growth was 7.2; consistent growth and methane production were not observed below pH 5.9 or above pH 8.2. The doubling time under optimal growth conditions was 7.5 h.

Characterization of a strain, E1-9c(T), associated with uncultured group E1, from a minerotrophic fen is reported. Cells were regular cocci, usually found in pairs, that stained Gram-positive and were resistant to lysis by 0.1 {\%} SDS. Multiple flagella were observed, but motility was not observed in wet mounts. Optimal growth was obtained at moderate temperatures (28-30 degrees C) and slightly acidic pH (5.5). Total Na(+) and NaCl were only tolerated at concentrations less than 100 mM and 0.5 {\%}, respectively, and Na(2)S concentrations above 0.1 mM were inhibitory. H(2)/CO(2) and formate were the only methanogenic substrates used by E1-9c(T); formate concentrations above 50 mM were inhibitory for growth. Vitamins, coenzyme M and acetate (4 mM) were required for growth and the doubling time was about 19 h. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and inferred McrA amino acid sequences showed that E1-9c(T) represented an independent lineage within the order Methanomicrobiales. Physiological and phylogenetic comparisons with different members of the order supported classification of E1-9c(T) in a new genus in the Methanomicrobiales. The name Methanosphaerula palustris gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed; strain E1-9c(T) (=ATCC BAA-1565(T) =DSM 19958(T)) is the type strain of Methanosphaerula palustris.},

The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies of R1 averaged 70-80{\%}, at organic loading rates of 0.5-1.3 kg COD m-3 day-1, between 20 and 12 °C. The COD removal efficiencies of R2 exceeded 90{\%}, at organic loading rates up to 13.3 kg COD m-3 day-1, between 20 and 14 °C. Lowering the operating temperature of R2 to 12 °C resulted in a decrease in COD removal efficiency, to between 50{\%} and 60{\%}, and a disintegration of granular sludge. The decline in performance, and granule disintegration, was reversed by decreasing the organic loading rate of R2 to 6.6 kg m-3 day-1. Specific methanogenic activity profiles revealed mesophilic (37 °C) temperature optima for biomass in both reactors, even after 500 days of psychrophilic operation, although the development of psychrotolerance in the biomass was noted.},

abstract = {In view of the realization that fossil fuels reserves are limited, various options of generating energy are being explored. Biological methods for producing fuels such as ethanol, diesel, hydrogen (H2), methane, etc. have the potential to provide a sustainable energy system for the society. Biological H2 production appears to be the most promising as it is non-polluting and can be produced from water and biological wastes. The major limiting factors are low yields, lack of industrially robust organisms, and high cost of feed. Actually, H2 yields are lower than theoretically possible yields of 4 mol/mol of glucose because of the associated fermentation products such as lactic acid, propionic acid and ethanol. The efficiency of energy production can be improved by screening microbial diversity and easily fermentable feed materials. Biowastes can serve as feed for H2 production through a set of microbial consortia: (1) hydrolytic bacteria, (2) H2 producers (dark fermentative and photosynthetic). The efficiency of the bioconversion process may be enhanced further by the production of value added chemicals such as polydroxyalkanoate and anaerobic digestion. Discovery of enormous microbial diversity and sequencing of a wide range of organisms may enable us to realize genetic variability, identify organisms with natural ability to acquire and transmit genes. Such organisms can be exploited through genome shuffling for transgenic expression and efficient generation of clean fuel and other diverse biotechnological applications.},

abstract = {The characteristics of granular sludge from full-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors used for the treatment of brewery wastewater were investigated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses of settled granules from a reactor that had been treating brewery wastewater stably at COD removal rates of over 90{\%} for more than 6 months showed that a methanogen of the genus Methanosaeta was predominant near the granule surface and that Bacteria were not abundant. The center of the granules was composed of dead or resting cells, or both, which were used as a support for active archaeal and bacterial cells near the surface. Periodic analysis of granules from full-scale plants showed that granules containing methanogens deep within them tended to float. Granules with a Bacteria layer on the surface also tended to float. On the basis of these findings, well-settled granules are considered to have methanogens that develop near the granule surface so that the gases generated during methane fermentation are readily released.},

The colonies produced by these bacteria are yellow, circular, and convex with lobate margins; an optical pattern of regular, light and dark striations throughout the colonies is a most unique and distinguishing characteristic. These striations are two cell lengths apart. Cells are gram negative and occur in filaments up to 100 µm in length. Tufts of polar flagella and a striated cell surface are revealed in electron micrographs; cell ends are blunt, not rounded. The deoxyribonucleic acid base composition of the type species is 45 mol{\%} guanine plus cytosine. Formate or hydrogen and carbon dioxide serves as a substrate for methane formation and growth; acetate, pyruvate, methanol, ethanol, and benzoate do not. The name Methanospirillum is proposed for this new genus of spiral-shaped methanogenic bacteria. The type species, Methanospirillum hungatii sp. nov., is named in honor of R. E. Hungate.

The high specific gas productions for the different digestion processes were 0.56, 0.61 and 0.85 l g(-1) total volatile solids (TVS) removal for digesters treating AW, FVW and AW + FVW, respectively. At an HRT of 20 days, biogas production rates from thermophilic digesters were higher on average than from mesophilic AW, FVW and AW + FVW digestion by 28.5, 44.5 and 25{\%}, respectively. However, at 10 days of HRT results showed a decrease of biogas production rate for AW and AW + FVW digestion processes due to the high amount of free ammonia at high organic loading rate (OLR).},

abstract = {The hydrolysis pretreatment of abattoir wastewaters (AW), rich in organic suspended solids (fats and protein) was studied in static and stirred batch reactors without aeration in the presence of natural microbial population acclimated in a storage tank of AW. Microbial analysis showed that the major populations which contribute to the pretreatment of AW belong to the genera Bacillus. Contrary to the static pretreatment, the stirred conditions favoured the hydrolysis and solubilization of 80{\%} of suspended matter into soluble pollution. The pretreated AW, in continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 days, was fed to an upflow anaerobic filter (UAF) at an HRT of 2 days. The performance of anaerobic digestion of biologically pretreated AW was examined under mesophilic (37 degrees C) and thermophilic (55 degrees C) conditions. The shifting from a mesophilic to a thermophilic environment in the UAF was carried out with a short start-up of thermophilic condition. The UAF ran at organic loading rates (OLRs) ranging from 0.9 to 6g COD/Ld in mesophilic conditions and at OLRs from 0.9 to 9 g COD/Ld in thermophilic conditions. COD removal efficiencies of 80-90{\%} were achieved for OLRs up to 4.5 g COD/Ld in mesophilic conditions, while the highest OLRs i.e. 9 g COD/Ld led to efficiencies of 70-72{\%} in thermophilic conditions. The biogas yield in thermophilic conditions was about 0.32-0.45 L biogas/g of COD removed for OLRs up to 4.5 g COD/Ld. For similar OLR, the UAF in mesophilic conditions showed lower percentage of methanization. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion has been shown to destroy pathogens partially, whereas the thermophilic process was more efficient in the removal of indicator microorganisms and pathogenic bacteria at different organic loading rates.},

We assessed both PCR amplified 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic approaches and generated 100,000+ to 1,000,000+ reads using 'post-light' based sequencing technology within different sized semi-conductor chips. Further development of Golay barcoded Ion Tags allowed multiplex analyses of microbial communities with substantially reduced costs compared with platforms such as 454/GS-FLX. Using these protocols we assessed the bacterial and archaeal dynamics within covered anaerobic digesters used to treat piggery wastes. Analysis of these sequence data showed that these novel methanogenic waste treatment systems are dominated by bacterial taxa, in particular Clostridium, Synergistia and Bacteroides that were maintained as a stable community over extended time periods. Archaeal community dynamics were more stochastic with the key methanogenic taxa more difficult to resolve, principally due to the poor congruence seen between community structures generated either by nested PCR or metagenomic approaches for archaeal analyses. Our results show that for microbial community structure and function analyses, the PGM platform provides a low cost, scalable and high throughput solution for both Tag sequencing and metagenomic analyses.},

Lysis-susceptibility experiments and analysis of transmission electron micrographs of strain ZC-1(T) suggested the presence of a proteinaceous cell wall. Strain ZC-1(T) used methanol, methylamine and trimethylamine as substrates for methanogenesis. Optimal growth, with a doubling time of around 5 h, occurred at pH 6.0-6.5, 65 degrees C, 0.3-0.5 M NaCl and 0.05-0.20 M MgCl(2). The DNA G+C content of this organism was 56 mol{\%}. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence and the inferred amino acid sequence of the mcrA gene of strain ZC-1(T) indicated that it is related specifically to members of the family Methanosaetaceae (90.6 and 76.6 {\%} sequence similarity, respectively). However, strain ZC-1(T) failed to grow with acetate as substrate for methanogenesis, which is a special characteristic of the family Methanosaetaceae.

Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of treating both industrial and domestic wastewaters at their discharge temperatures (usually {\textless}18 degrees C), thereby avoiding the heating expenses of mesophilic (20-45 degrees C) or thermophilic (45-65 degrees C) treatments. Previous low-temperature trials used mesophilic inocula and little information is available on the viability of low-temperature anaerobic granulation. Six laboratory-scale, expanded granular sludge bed bioreactors (R1-6) were operated at 15 degrees C (R1-2 and R4-5) and 37 degrees C (R3 and R6). R1-3 were fed glucose-based wastewater and R4-6 were fed volatile fatty acid-based wastewater. Quantitative real-time PCR and qualitative denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA genes identified the dominance of Methanomicrobiales (mainly Methanocorpusculum-like organisms) during low-temperature granulation. Granulation only occurred in glucose-fed bioreactors. The results suggest that (i) granulation is feasible in low-temperature bioreactors; (ii) carbohydrate decomposition likely favoured granulation, (iii) Methanocorpusculum-like organisms play a critical role in low-temperature granulation.},

abstract = {Methanosarcina semesiae MD1T (T = type strain), a novel obligately methylotrophic methanogenic archaeon is described. Strain MD1T was isolated from an enrichment on dimethylsulfide inoculated with mangrove sediment. The cells were irregularly coccoid, non-motile, 1.4+/-0.2 microm in diameter and stained Gram-positive. The catabolic substrates used included dimethylsulfide, methanethiol, methanol and methylated amines, but not acetate, formate, H2/CO2 or a combination of these substrates. When cells grown on dimethylsulfide were transferred to trimethylamine or methanol and vice versa, a lag phase was observed. The same lag phase occurred when cells grown on trimethylamine were transferred to methanol and vice versa, indicating that for each substrate different enzymes were induced. Fastest growth occurred within a temperature range of 30-35 degrees C and a pH of 6.5-7.5. Both Na+ and Mg2+ were required for growth, with maximum growth rates at 200-600 mM Na+ and 20-100 mM Mg2+. The cells exhibited specific growth rates (h-1) of 0.07+/-0.02, 0.15+/-0.04 and 0.18-/+0.05 on dimethylsulfide, methanol and trimethylamine, respectively. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain MD1T was phylogenetically closely related to members of the genus Methanosarcina, but clearly differed from all described species of this genus (94-97{\%} sequence similarity).},

The catabolic substrates used included methanol, methylated amines, and acetate, but not formate or H2/CO2. Growth was observed in a temperature range between 4 degrees and 27 degrees C with an optimum at 25 degrees C. The doubling time with methanol as substrate was 84 h at 25 degrees C, 120 h at 9 degrees C, and 167 h at 4 degrees C. The doubling time with acetate as substrate was 252 h at 25 degrees C and 425 h at 20 degrees C. After the transfer of methanol-grown cultures, long lag phases were observed that lasted 15-20 days at 25 degrees C and 25 days at 4 degrees -9 degrees C. The NaCl optimum for growth was 2{\%}-4{\%}, and the fastest growth occurred within a pH range of 6.5-7.5. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence revealed that the strain was phylogenetically related to Methanosarcina. The sequence similarity to described species of {\textless}95.7{\%} and its physiological properties distinguished strain GS1-A(T) from all described species of the genus Methanosarcina.},

Strain RMAS(T) grew solely on H(2)/CO(2) but required Casamino acids, tryptone, yeast extract or vitamins for growth. Growth of strain RMAS(T) was stimulated by acetate. Cells were non-motile, straight rods (0.5×3.5-10.5 µm) and occurred singly or in pairs. Bundles of fimbriae occurred at both poles of cells and the cell wall was thick (approximately 21 nm, as revealed by ultrathin section electron microscopy). Strain RMAS(T) grew at 45-80 °C (optimum, 70 °C), at pH 5.8-8.7 (optimum, pH 6.9-7.7) and with 0.001-20 g NaCl l(-1) (optimum, 2.5 g NaCl l(-1)).

Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) and moving-window analyses, based on quantitative real-time PCR data, along with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiling, demonstrated that the methanogenic communities developed in a different manner in these reactor configurations. A comparable level of performance was recorded for both systems at 37°C and 25°C, but a more dynamic and diverse microbial community in the IFB reactors supported better stability and adaptative capacity towards low temperature operation. The emergence and maintenance of particular bacterial genotypes (phylum Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) was associated with efficient protein hydrolysis in the IFB, while protein hydrolysis was inefficient in the EGSB. A significant community shift from a Methanobacteriales and Methanosaetaceae towards a Methanomicrobiales-predominated community was demonstrated during operation at 15°C in both reactor configurations.},

abstract = {In view of the realization that fossil fuels reserves are limited, various options of generating energy are being explored. Biological methods for producing fuels such as ethanol, diesel, hydrogen (H2), methane, etc. have the potential to provide a sustainable energy system for the society. Biological H2 production appears to be the most promising as it is non-polluting and can be produced from water and biological wastes. The major limiting factors are low yields, lack of industrially robust organisms, and high cost of feed. Actually, H2 yields are lower than theoretically possible yields of 4 mol/mol of glucose because of the associated fermentation products such as lactic acid, propionic acid and ethanol. The efficiency of energy production can be improved by screening microbial diversity and easily fermentable feed materials. Biowastes can serve as feed for H2 production through a set of microbial consortia: (1) hydrolytic bacteria, (2) H2 producers (dark fermentative and photosynthetic). The efficiency of the bioconversion process may be enhanced further by the production of value added chemicals such as polydroxyalkanoate and anaerobic digestion. Discovery of enormous microbial diversity and sequencing of a wide range of organisms may enable us to realize genetic variability, identify organisms with natural ability to acquire and transmit genes. Such organisms can be exploited through genome shuffling for transgenic expression and efficient generation of clean fuel and other diverse biotechnological applications.},

abstract = {Biomass samples taken during the continuous operation of thermophilic anaerobic digestors fed with manure and exposed to successive inhibitory pulses of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) were characterized in terms of specific metabolic activities and 16S rDNA DGGE profiling of the microbial community structure. Improvement of hydrogenotrophic and acidogenic ([beta]-oxidation) activity rates was detected upon successive LCFA pulses, while different inhibition effects over specific anaerobic trophic groups were observed. Bioreactor recovery capacity and biomass adaptation to LCFA inhibition were verified. Population profiles of eubacterial and archaeal 16S rDNA genes revealed that no significant shift on microbial community composition took place upon biomass exposure to LCFA. DNA sequencing of predominant DGGE bands showed close phylogenetic affinity to ribotypes characteristic from specific [beta]-oxidation bacterial genera (Syntrophomonas and Clostridium), while a single predominant syntrophic archaeae was related with the genus Methanosarcina. The hypothesis that biomass adaptation was fundamentally of physiological nature was tested using mathematical modelling, taking the IWA ADM1 as general model. New kinetics considering the relation between LCFA inhibitory substrate concentration and specific biomass content, as an approximation to the adsorption process, improved the model fitting and provided a better insight on the physical nature of the LCFA inhibition process.},

Cells were non-motile, rod-shaped, 0.7-1.0 microm by 2.0 microm, and formed multicellular filaments longer than 8 microm. Growth was observed between 35 and 55 degrees C (optimum 50 degrees C) and pH 6.7 and 8.0 (optimum pH 7.0). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.3 mol{\%}. The strain utilized H(2) and formate for growth and methane production. Based on comparative sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA gene and mcrA gene (encoding the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, a key enzyme in the methane-production pathway), strain NOBI-1(T) was affiliated with the order Methanomicrobiales, but it was significantly distant from any other known species within the order. The most closely related species based on 16S rRNA and mcrA gene sequence similarity were respectively 'Candidatus Methanoregula boonei' (93.7{\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Methanocorpusculum parvum (74.2{\%} deduced McrA amino acid sequence similarity to the type strain).

abstract = {The kinetics of propionate degradation, acetate splitting, and hydrogen consumption in digesting sludge were investigated in a lab-scale digester. At natural steady-state conditions, the acetate-splitting systems in well-digested sludge were about half saturated. Propionate-degrading systems were saturated to only 10 to 15{\%}, and hydrogen removal was less than 1{\%} of the maximum possible rate. It was concluded that acetate splitting rather than "methanogenesis from fatty acids" is the rate-limiting reaction in the anaerobic degradation of dissolved organic matter and that a methoanogenic anaerobic ecosystem is stabilized by its large unused capacity of hydrogen consumption which is "buffering" the partial pressure of dissolved hydrogen in the system at sufficiently low values to permit rapid fatty acid oxidation. A tentative scheme of the substrate flow in sludge digestion is presented. It suggests that acid formation coupled with hydrogen formation via pyridine dinucleotide oxidation yields the immediate substrates, namely acetate and hydrogen, for about 54{\%} of the total methanogenesis.},

abstract = {Two lab-scale, mesophilic anaerobic digesters (namely reactors R-1 and R-2) were operated simultaneously for continuous production of biogas from fodder beet silage as monosubstrate. The digesters were operated by a control system, developed at HAW Hamburg, which allowed an automatic auto-feeding up to a given maximum set-point. Within a period of 400 days of investigation, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) for reactor R-1 was adjusted to 10–12.5 days, and for reactor R-2, only to 6 days. The organic loading rate (OLR) varied with the total solids (TS) content of the harvest charge, ranging between 3.5 and 5 kg VS m 3 d 1. Although both digesters were run under stable conditions, indicated by low volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentrations below 200 mg l 1, the specific gas production rate (spec. GPR) declined over time to 0.55 and 0.40 l g VS 1 d 1, for R-1 and R-2, respectively. Therefore, it seemed that some nutrients were deprived, particularly in reactor R-2, which had a short HRT of 6 days. After supplementation with phosphate and sulphate, the improvement of the spec. GPR was 11{\%} for reactor R-1, and 20{\%} for reactor R-2. Simultaneously performed anaerobic batch digestion test series with the beet silage also confirmed the positive effect of these nutrients on the spec. GPR. Furthermore, quantitative microscopic counts exhibited that the addition of these nutrients had no significant effect on the performance of reactor R-1, but the number of the fluorescent methanogenic bacteria increased four-fold in the high throughput reactor R-2, after supplementation with phosphate. However, additional supplementation with sulphate had no further effect on the performance of R-2. Therefore, phosphate seems to be the limiting macro-nutrient for anaerobic digestion of fodder beet silage, especially under high loading conditions.},

abstract = {A novel thermophilic, obligately methylotrophic, methanogenic archaeon, strain L2FAW(T), was isolated from a thermophilic laboratory-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor fed with methanol as the carbon and energy source. Cells of strain L2FAW(T) were non-motile, irregular cocci, 0.7-1.5 mum in diameter and usually occurred singly (sometimes forming clusters of two or four cells). The cells stained Gram-negative and lysed immediately in 0.1 {\%} (w/v) SDS. Growth was inhibited by chloramphenicol and tetracycline, but not by penicillin, bacitracin, spectinomycin, vancomycin or kanamycin. Methanol and mono-, di- and trimethylamine were used as substrates, but H2/CO2, formate, acetate, propanol, dimethyl sulfide and methanethiol were not. The temperature range for growth was 42-58 degrees C, with an optimum at 50 degrees C. The fastest growth was observed at a salinity below 100 mM NaCl; no growth occurred above 300 mM NaCl. The optimal pH for growth was 6.5; growth was observed from pH 5 to pH 7.5. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 37.6 mol{\%}. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence and the partial methyl-CoM reductase gene sequence revealed that the organism was phylogenetically closely related to Methanomethylovorans hollandica DMS1T (98 {\%} similarity for the 16S rRNA gene sequence and 91 {\%} similarity for the methyl-CoM reductase gene sequence). The DNA-DNA relatedness between L2FAW(T) and Methanomethylovorans hollandica DMS1T was 46 {\%}. On the basis of these results, strain L2FAW(T) (=DSM 17232T=ATCC BAA-1173T) represents the type strain of a novel species, for which the name Methanomethylovorans thermophila sp. nov. is proposed.},

The slower-growing subgroup had a Ks of 11 mg/liter and a mumax of 0.0054 h-1 which is similar to the mumax reported for Syntrophobacter wolinii. The faster-growing group had a mumax of 0.050 h-1 and a Ks of 330 mg/liter.

Cells of strains 8AcT and 6Ac were rod-shaped (0.8-1.0 x 3-5 microm) and non-motile, occurring singly or in pairs; however, at high cell density the cells were arranged in long chains within a common sheath. The two strains used acetate exclusively for growth and methane production. The specific growth rate of strain 8AcT was 0.030 h(-1) when growing in acetate (20 mM) at 37 degrees C. The temperature range for growth was 25-45 degrees C, with the fastest growth at 34-37 degrees C. The pH range for growth and methane production was 6.5-9.0, with the fastest growth at pH 7.2-7.6. The G+C content of genomic DNA of strain 8AcT was 55.7 mol{\%}. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity showed that the novel strains clustered with Methanosaeta species; the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain 8AcT and Methanosaeta concilii DSM 3013 and 'Methanosaeta thermophila' DSM 6194 were 92.5 and 87.3 {\%}, respectively. The sequence similarity levels of mcrA, the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, and of the deduced amino acids of mcrA, between strain 8AcT and Methanosaeta concilii DSM 3671T were 36 and 78.9 {\%}, respectively.

abstract = {Previous studies suggested that methanol and acetate were the likely methanogenic precursors in the cold Zoige wetland. In this study, the contribution of the two substances to methanogenesis and the conversion in Zoige wetland were analyzed. It was determined that methanol supported the highest CH(4) formation rate in the enrichments of the soil grown with Eleocharis valleculosa, and even higher at 15 degrees C than at 30 degrees C; while hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was higher at 30 degrees C. Both methanol- and acetate-using methanogens were counted at the highest (10(7) g(-1)) in the soil, whereas methanol-using acetogens (10(8) g(-1)) were ten times more abundant than either methanol- or acetate-using methanogens. Both methanol and acetate were detected in the methanogenesis-inhibited soil samples, so that both could be the primary methanogenic precursors in E. valleculosa soil. However, the levels of methanol and acetate accumulated in 2-bromoethane-sulfonate (BES)- and CHCl(3)-treated soils were in reverse, i.e., higher methanol in CHCl(3)- and higher acetate in BES-treated soil, so that methanol-derived methanogenesis could be underestimated due to the consumption by acetogens. Analysis of the soil 16S rRNA genes revealed Acetobacterum bakii and Trichococcus pasteurii to be the dominant methanol-using acetogens in the soil, and a strain of T. pasteurii was isolated, which showed the high conversion of methanol to acetate at 15 degrees C.},

Cultures were dimorphic, containing thin rods (0.2-0.3 $\mu$m in diameter and 0.8-3.0 $\mu$m long) and irregular cocci (0.2-0.8 $\mu$m in diameter). The culture utilized H(2)/CO(2) to produce methane but did not utilize formate, acetate, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, butanol or trimethylamine. Optimal growth conditions were near pH 5.1 and 35 °C. The culture grew in basal medium containing as little as 0.43 mM Na(+) and growth was inhibited completely by 50 mM NaCl. To our knowledge, strain 6A8(T) is one of the most acidiphilic (lowest pH optimum) and salt-sensitive methanogens in pure culture.

The homogenized cells of M. es also showed bright fluorescing rods with MX 825 hybridization. The culture obtained on inoculation of the released endosymbiotic organisms on Methanosaeta-specific medium lent support to the growth of long slender rods having the same range of mean length (3.6 microm) as that of the endosymbiotic methanogens observed.

Kinetic parameters were determined from progress curves fitted to the integrated form of the Michaelis-Menten equation. The apparent half-saturation constants, Km, for butyrate, acetate, and dissolved hydrogen were 76 {\{}micro{\}}M, 0.4 mM, and 8.5 {\{}micro{\}}M, respectively. Butyrate and hydrogen were metabolized to a concentration of less than 1 {\{}micro{\}}M, whereas acetate uptake usually ceased at a concentration of 25 to 75 {\{}micro{\}}M, indicating a threshold level for acetate uptake. No significant differences in Km values for butyrate degradation were found between chemostat- and batch-grown tricultures, although the maximum growth rate was somewhat higher in the batch cultures in which the medium was supplemented with yeast extract. Acetate utilization was found to be the rate-limiting reaction for complete degradation of butyrate to methane and carbon dioxide in continuous culture. Increasing the dilution rate resulted in a gradual accumulation of acetate. The results explain the low concentrations of butyrate and hydrogen normally found during anaerobic digestion and the observation that acetate is the first volatile fatty acid to accumulate upon a decrease in retention time or increase in organic loading of a digestor.},

abstract = {The biological oxidations and reductions occurring in batch anaerobic digesters may approach equilibrium. The approach depends strongly on the activities of the micro-organisms present. The thermodynamics of linear long chain fatty acid degradation in a batch reactor was modeled. The substrates considered are the saturated fatty acids from acetic acid to stearic acid. From the thermodynamic perspective, the fermentation (acidogenesis and acetogenesis), decomposing the long chain saturated fatty acids to acetic acid though shorter chain acids, could not proceed spontaneously ([Delta]H {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 0 and [Delta]G {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 0). However the model suggests that the major driving force for the fermentation may be found in the methanogenesis. The model results show two distinct cases: ([Delta]S {\textgreater} 0 and [Delta]H {\textgreater} 0) and ([Delta]S {\textless} 0 and [Delta]H {\textless} 0), relating to spontaneous but endothermic and non-spontaneous but exothermic processes respectively. Where, spontaneous digestion is associated with high initial concentrations of LCFA and endotherm. This implies that the digestion of this type of substrate might be better facilitated by the supply of supplemental heat. The digestion of very low concentrations of LCFA is found to be non-spontaneous due in large part to the solubility of carbon dioxide. This implies that the digestion of this type of substrate might be enabled by selectively removing carbon dioxide.},

abstract = {Anaerobic digestion modeling started in the early 1970s when the need for design and efficient operation of anaerobic systems became evident. At that time not only was the knowledge about the complex process of anaerobic digestion inadequate but also there were computational limitations. Thus, the first models were very simple and consisted of a limited number of equations. During the past thirty years much research has been conducted on the peculiarities of the process and on the factors that influence it on the one hand while an enormous progress took place in computer science on the other. The combination of both parameters resulted in the development of more and more concise and complex models. In this chapter the most important models found in the literature are described starting from the simplest and oldest to the more recent and complex ones.},

abstract = {Two methanogenic strains, 8AcT and 6Ac, were isolated from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating beer-manufacture wastewater in Beijing, China. Cells of strains 8AcT and 6Ac were rod-shaped (0.8-1.0 x 3-5 microm) and non-motile, occurring singly or in pairs; however, at high cell density the cells were arranged in long chains within a common sheath. The two strains used acetate exclusively for growth and methane production. The specific growth rate of strain 8AcT was 0.030 h(-1) when growing in acetate (20 mM) at 37 degrees C. The temperature range for growth was 25-45 degrees C, with the fastest growth at 34-37 degrees C. The pH range for growth and methane production was 6.5-9.0, with the fastest growth at pH 7.2-7.6. The G+C content of genomic DNA of strain 8AcT was 55.7 mol{\%}. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity showed that the novel strains clustered with Methanosaeta species; the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain 8AcT and Methanosaeta concilii DSM 3013 and 'Methanosaeta thermophila' DSM 6194 were 92.5 and 87.3 {\%}, respectively. The sequence similarity levels of mcrA, the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, and of the deduced amino acids of mcrA, between strain 8AcT and Methanosaeta concilii DSM 3671T were 36 and 78.9 {\%}, respectively. Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses, the novel species Methanosaeta harundinacea sp. nov. is proposed, with strain 8AcT (= JCM 13211T = CGMCC 1.5026T) as the type strain.},

The grew between 84 and 110°C (opt: 98°C) and from 0.2{\%} to 4{\%} NaCl (opt. 2{\%}) and pH 5.5 to 7 (opt: 6.5). The isolates were obligate chemolithoautotrophes using H2/CO2 as energy and carbon sources. In the presence of sulfur, H2S was formed and cells tended to lyse. The cell wall consisted of a new type of pseudomurein containing ornithin in addition to lysine and no N-acetylglucosamine. The pseudomurein layer was covered by a detergent-sensitive protein surface layer. The core lipid consisted exclusively of phytanyl diether. The GC content of the DNA was 60 mol{\%}. By 16S rRNA comparisons the new organisms were not related to any of the three methanogenic lineages. Based on the physiological and molecular properties of the new isolates, we describe here a new genus, which we name Methanopyrus (the “methane fire”).

abstract = {A novel mesophilic, hydrogenotrophic methanogen, designated strain TNRT, was isolated from an anaerobic, propionate-degradation enrichment culture that was originally established from a rice field soil sample from Taiwan. Cells were non-motile rods, 2.0–6.5 µm long by 0.3 µm wide. Filamentous (up to about 100 µm) and coccoid (about 1 µm in diameter) cells were also observed in cultures in the late exponential phase of growth. Strain TNRT grew at 20–40 °C (optimally at 37 °C), at pH 6.5–7.4 (optimally at pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0–25 g NaCl l−1 (optimally at 0 g NaCl l−1). The strain utilized H2/CO2 and formate for growth and produced methane. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.4 mol{\%}. Based on sequences of both the 16S rRNA gene and the methanogen-specific marker gene mcrA, strain TNRT was related most closely to Methanolinea tarda NOBI-1T; levels of sequence similarities were 94.8 and 86.4 {\%}, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity indicates that strain TNRT and M. tarda NOBI-1T represent different species within the same genus. This is supported by shared phenotypic properties, including substrate usage and cell morphology, and differences in growth temperature. Based on these genetic and phenotypic properties, strain TNRT is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Methanolinea, for which the name Methanolinea mesophila sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is TNRT ( = NBRC 105659T = DSM 23604T). In addition, we also suggest family status for the E1/E2 group within the order Methanomicrobiales, for which the name Methanoregulaceae fam. nov. is proposed; the type genus of family is Methanoregula. },

abstract = {A small irregular coccoid methanogenic bacterium (PAT) was isolated from the hindgut of the cockroach Periplaneta americana. Fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy of the hindgut of P. americana suggest that the organism occurs abundantly in the microbiota attached to the hindgut wall. The strain produces methane by the reduction of methanol and methylated amines with molecular hydrogen. Acetate, coenzyme M, yeast extract, tryptic soy broth and vitamins are required for growth. The cells lack a rigid cell wall and lyse immediately in buffers of low ionic strength. Maximum rate of growth (specific growth rate, 0.22 h(-1)) occurs in a rich medium at 39 degrees C, at a pH range of 7.2-7.7 and at a salt concentration below 100 mM NaCl. Sequence analysis of the small-subunit rDNA indicates that strain PAT is related to the family Methanosarcinaceae but does not belong to any previously described genus. Therefore, it is proposed that strain PAT be classified in a new genus, related to the Methanosarcinaceae, as Methanomicrococcus blatticola (type strain PAT = DSM 13328T).},

abstract = {Five strains of methanogenic archaea (MT, MS, MM, MSP, ZB) were isolated from permanently and periodically cold terrestrial habitats. Physiological and morphological studies, as well as phylogenetic analyses of the new isolates were performed. Based on sequences of the 16S rRNA and methyl-coenzyme M reductase a-subunit (mcrA) genes all new isolates are closely related to known mesophilic and psychrotolerant methanogens. Both, phylogenetic analyses and phenotypic properties allow to classify strains MT, MS, and MM as members of the genus Methanosarcina. Strain MT is a new ecotype of Methanosarcina mazei, whereas strains MM and MS are very similar to each other and can be assigned to the recently described psychrotolerant species Methanosarcina lacustris. The hydrogenotrophic strain MSP is a new ecotype of the genus Methanocorpusculum. The obligately methylotrophic strain ZB is closely related to Methanomethylovorans hollandica and can be classified as new ecotype of this species. All new isolates, including the strains from permanently cold environments, are not true psychrophiles according to their growth temperature characteristics. In spite of the ability of all isolates to grow at temperatures as low as 1-5 degrees C, all of them have their growth optima in the range of moderate temperatures (25-35 degrees C). Thus, they can be regarded as psychrotolerant organisms. Psychrotolerant methanogens are thought to play an important role in methane production in both, habitats under seasonal temperature variations or from permanently cold areas.},

abstract = {Methanogenesis of glucose by defined thermophilic coculture of Clostridium thermoaceticum 1745 and Methanosarcina sp. CHTI 55 was carried out to establish a symbiotic culture. In the coculture, glucose was first converted to acetate (inhibitory product) by C. thermoaceticum and the acetate was subsequently reduced to CH4 and CO2 by Methanosarcina sp., suggesting that acetoclastic methanogenesis was the rate limiting step of the system. The inoculum ratio of Methanosarcina sp.(M) to C. thermoaceticum (C), M/C, was a key parameter capable of controlling acetate disappearance during culture, i.e., an M/C of 9.5 resulted in acetate appearance at the beginning of culture, although no acetate accumulation was observed by an M/C of 45.8 yielding 80 mM methane from 40 mM glucose within 4 d culture. The growth kinetics of each monoculture were studied in order to conduct kinetic analysis of the coculture system. The inhibition kinetics of glucose (substrate) and acetate (product) on the growth of C. thermoaceticum were analyzed by a second-order substrate inhibition model coupled with a non-competitive product inhibition model. The analysis revealed that the substrate saturation constant values were Ks = 80.1 mM glucose; substrate inhibition constant, Ki = 104.4 mM glucose; and inhibition constant, Kp = 0.218 mM (undissociated acetic acid); exponent of inhibition, n = 1.04; and [mu]m was 0.19 h-1. Using a similar second-order substrate inhibition model, the values for Methanosarcina sp. were Ks = 0.13 mM; Ki = 0.62 mM (undissociated acetic acid); and the maximum specific rate of CH4 production, qm = 17.31 ml CH4/g cell/h.},

abstract = {Methanogenesis from ethanol by defined mixed continuous cultures was studied. Under sulfate-free conditions, a Desulfovibrio strain was used as the ethanol-degrading species producing acetic acid and hydrogen. In a two-membered mutualistic coculture, the hydrogen was converted to methane by a Methanobacterium sp. and pH was maintained at neutrality by the addition of alkali. Introduction of a third species, the acetate-utilizing Methanosarcina mazei, obviated the need for external pH control. Methanogenesis by the co-and triculture was studied at various dilution rates in the steady state. The mutualistic coculture performed like a composite single species, as predicted from the theory of mutualistic interactions. Coupling between the mutualistic coculture and the acetate-utilizing methanogen was less tight. Increasing the dilution rate destabilized the triculture; at low dilution rates, instability was soon recovered, but at higher dilution rates imbalance between the rates of production and removal of acetic acid led to a drop in pH. Flocs formed in the triculture. An annulus of the Methanobacterium sp. and Desulfovibrio sp. was retained around the Methanosarcina sp. by strands of material probably derived from the Methanosarcina sp.},

abstract = {In the present study, the diversity of methanogenic populations was monitored for 25 days, together with the process data for an anaerobic batch reactor treating waste-activated sludge. To understand this microbial diversity and dynamics, 16S rRNA-gene-targeted denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting was conducted at two different taxonomic levels: the domain and order levels. The DGGE profiles of the domain Archaea and the three orders Methanosarcinales, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanobacteriales were comparatively analyzed after each DGGE band was sequenced to enable identification. The DGGE profiles of the three orders showed methanogens belonging to each order that were not detected in the DGGE profile of the Archaea. This discrepancy may have resulted from PCR bias or differences in the abundances of the three microbial orders in the anaerobic bioreactor. In conclusion, to fully understand the detailed methanogenic diversity and dynamics in an anaerobic bioreactor, it is necessary to conduct DGGE analysis with 16S rRNA gene primers that target lower taxonomic groups.},

The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 60.9 mol{\%}. Strain HASU(T) utilized ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, hydrogen and formate for growth and methane production. It converted ethanol to methane and acetate. Based on comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain HASU(T) was shown to be affiliated with the genus Methanofollis. It was related most closely to the type strain of Methanofollis liminatans (96.1 {\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity).

The cells were irregular cocci, non-motile, 1.5-2.0 microm in diameter and Gram-negative. Cells of strain ML15(T) lysed easily in the presence of SDS (0.1 g l(-1)) and the S-layer protein had an M(r) of 138 800. The catabolic substrates utilized by this strain included formate and H(2)/CO(2), but not acetate, methanol, trimethylamine or secondary alcohols. Growth did not occur in minimal medium, but was observed when yeast extract and tryptone were added. Strain ML15(T) grew fastest at 37 degrees C, pH 6.6-7.0 and with 3 {\%} NaCl. Acetate was not required for cell growth. Trace amounts of tungstate promoted cell growth. The G+C contents of DNA of Methanofollis aquaemaris N2F9704(T) and strain ML15(T) were 59.1 and 58.4 mol{\%}, respectively. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of strain ML15(T) and selected Methanofollis species revealed similarities of 95-97 {\%}. Based on the data presented here, it is proposed that strain ML15(T) (=OCM 789(T)=DSM 15483(T)) represents a novel species, Methanofollis formosanus sp. nov.},

abstract = {Archaea have been isolated from the human colon, vagina, and oral cavity, but have not been established as causes of human disease. In this study, we reveal a relationship between the severity of periodontal disease and the relative abundance of archaeal small subunit ribosomal RNA genes (SSU rDNA) in the subgingival crevice by using quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the relative abundance of archaeal small subunit rDNA decreased at treated sites in association with clinical improvement. Archaea were harbored by 36{\%} of periodontitis patients and were restricted to subgingival sites with periodontal disease. The presence of archaeal cells at these sites was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The archaeal community at diseased sites was dominated by a Methanobrevibacter oralis-like phylotype and a distinct Methanobrevibacter subpopulation related to archaea that inhabit the gut of numerous animals. We hypothesize that methanogens participate in syntrophic relationships in the subgingival crevice that promote colonization by secondary fermenters during periodontitis. Because they are potential alternative syntrophic partners, our finding of larger Treponema populations sites without archaea provides further support for this hypothesis.},

abstract = {The Zoige wetland of the Tibetan plateau is at permanent low temperatures and is a methane emission heartland of the plateau; however, cold-adaptive methanogens in the soil are poorly understood. In this study, a variety of methanogenic enrichments at 15C and 30C were obtained from the wetland soil. It was demonstrated that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the most efficient type at 30C, while methanol supported the highest methanogenesis rate at 15C. Moreover, methanol was the only substrate to produce methane more efficiently at 15C than at 30C. A novel psychrophilic methanogen, strain R15, was isolated from the methanol enrichment at 15C. Phylogenetic analysis placed strain R15 within the genus Methanolobus, loosely clustered with Methanolobus taylorii (96.7{\%} 16S rRNA similarity). R15 produced methane from methanol, trimethylamine, and methyl sulfide and differed from other Methanolobus species by growing and producing methane optimally at 18C (specific growth rate of 0.063 0.001 h1) and even at 0C. Based on these characteristics, R15 was proposed to be a new species and named Methanolobus psychrophilus sp. nov. The Km and V max of R15 for methanol conversion were determined to be 87.5 0.4 $\mu$M and 0.39 0.04 mM h1 at 18C, respectively, indicating a high affinity and conversion efficiency for methanol. The proportion of R15 in the soil was determined by quantitative PCR, and it accounted for 17.2{\%} 2.1{\%} of the total archaea, enumerated as 107 per gram of soil; the proportion was increased to 42.4{\%} 2.3{\%} in the methanol enrichment at 15C. This study suggests that the psychrophilic methanogens in the Zoige wetland are likely to be methylotrophic and to play a role in methane emission of the wetland.},

abstract = {A microbial enrichment culture from brackish sediments was able to grow on octadec-1-ene (an unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon) as sole source of carbon and energy, under methanogenic conditions. Octadecene degradation is stopped either when bromoethanesulfonic acid, a selective inhibitor of methanogenesis is introduced, or when hydrogen is introduced. In the presence of bromoethanesulfonic acid, the degradation is restored by the addition of a hydrogenotrophic sulfate-reducing microorganism with sulfate. Results of molecular biodiversity, which revealed the presence of bacteria as well as of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, are consistent with a syntrophic degradation involving Bacteria and Archaea. This is the first demonstration of syntrophic alkene degradation by microbial communities, showing that syntrophy is more widespread than we could have thought so far. These results highlight the need for a better understanding of microbial interactions and their role in the organic-matter degradation in polluted environments.},

Under sulfate-reducing conditions, a Desulfovibrio strain was used as the furfural-degrading species producing acetic acid. This sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Desulfovibrio strain B is an incomplete oxidizer, unable to carry out the terminal oxidation of organic substrates, leaving acetic acid as the end product. Introduction of acetate-utilizing methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina barkeri 227 converted acetic acid to methane. This well-defined mixed consortium used furfural as its sole source of carbon and converted it to methane and CO2. In the mixed culture, when a methanogen inhibitor was used in the culture medium, furfural was converted to acetic acid by the Desulfovibrio strain B, but acetic acid did not undergo further metabolism. On the other hand, when the growth of Desulfovibrio in the consortium was suppressed with a specific SRB inhibitor, namely molybdate, furfural was not degraded. Thus, the metabolic activities of both Desulfovibrio strain B and M. barkeri 227 were essential for the complete degradation of furfural.},

Methanocorpusculum strains are weakly motile and form irregularly coccoid cells, about 1 gm in diameter. The cell envelope consists of a cytoplasmic membrane and a S-layer, composed of hexagonally arranged glycoprotein subunits with molecular weights of 90000 (Methanocorpusculum parvurn), 92000 (M. sinense), and 94000 (M. bavaricurn). The center-to-center spacings are 14.3 nm, 15.8 nm and 16.0 nm, respectively. Optimal growth of strains is obtained in the mesophilic temperature range and at a pH around 7. Methane is produced from H2/CO2, formate, 2-propanol/CO2 and 2-butanol/COz by M. parvurn and M. bavaricum, whereas M. sinense can only utilize Hz/ CO2 and formate. Growth of M. sinense and M. bavaricum is dependent on the presence of clarified rumen fluid. The G + C content of the DNA of the three strains is ranging from 47.7- 53.6 mol{\%} as determined by different methods. A similar, but distinct polar lipid pattern indicates a close relationship between the three Methanocorpusculum species. The polyamine patterns of M. parvurn, M. sinense and M. bavaricum are similar, but distinct from those of other methanogens and are characterized by a high concentration of the otherwise rare 1,3-diaminopropane. Quantitative comparison of the antigenic fingerprint of members of Methanocorpusculum revealed no antigenic relationship with any one of the reference methanogens tested. On the basis of the distant phylogenetic position of M. parvum and the data presented in this paper a new family, the Methanocorpusculaceae faro. nov., is defined.},

abstract = {A novel chemolithoautotrophic, hyperthermophilic methanogen was isolated from a submarine hydrothermal system at the Kolbeinsey Ridge, north of Iceland. Based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence, the strain belongs to the order Methanococcales within the genus Methanocaldococcus, with approximately 95 {\%} sequence similarity to Methanocaldococcus jannaschii as its closest relative. Cells of the novel organism stained Gram-negative and appeared as regular to irregular cocci possessing more than 50 polar flagella. These cell appendages mediated not only motility but also adherence to abiotic surfaces and the formation of cell-cell contacts. The new isolate grew at 55-90 °C, with optimum growth at 80 °C. The optimum NaCl concentration for growth was 2.5 {\%} (w/v), and the optimal pH was 6.5. The cells gained their energy exclusively by reduction of CO(2) with H(2). Selenate, tungstate and yeast extract stimulated growth significantly. The genome size was determined to be in the range 1.8-2.0 kb, and the G+C content of the genomic DNA was 30 mol{\%}. Despite being physiologically nearly identical to the other members of the genus Methanocaldococcus, analysis of whole-cell proteins revealed significant differences. Based on the results from phylogenetic, morphological and protein analyses, we conclude that the novel strain represents a novel species of the genus Methanocaldococcus, for which the name Methanocaldococcus villosus sp. nov. is proposed (type strain KIN24-T80(T) = DSM 22612(T) = JCM 16315(T)).},

abstract = {Anaerobic digestion is an attractive waste treatment practice in which both pollution control and energy recovery can be achieved. Many agricultural and industrial wastes are ideal candidates for anaerobic digestion because they contain high levels of easily biodegradable materials. Problems such as low methane yield and process instability are often encountered in anaerobic digestion, preventing this technique from being widely applied. A wide variety of inhibitory substances are the primary cause of anaerobic digester upset or failure since they are present in substantial concentrations in wastes. Considerable research efforts have been made to identify the mechanism and the controlling factors of inhibition. This review provides a detailed summary of the research conducted on the inhibition of anaerobic processes. The inhibitors commonly present in anaerobic digesters include ammonia, sulfide, light metal ions, heavy metals, and organics. Due to the difference in anaerobic inocula, waste composition, and experimental methods and conditions, literature results on inhibition caused by specific toxicants vary widely. Co-digestion with other waste, adaptation of microorganisms to inhibitory substances, and incorporation of methods to remove or counteract toxicants before anaerobic digestion can significantly improve the waste treatment efficiency.},

abstract = {Methanogenic archaea conserve energy for growth by reducing some one- and two-carbon compounds to methane and concomitantly generating an ion motive force. Growth of Methanosarcina acetivorans on carbon monoxide (CO) is peculiar as it involves formation of, besides methane, formate, acetate and methylated thiols. It has been argued that methane formation is partially inhibited under carboxidotrophic conditions and that the other products result from either detoxification of CO or from bypassing methanogenesis with other pathways for energy conservation. To gain a deeper understanding of the CO-dependent physiology of M. acetivorans we analyzed metabolite formation in resting cells. The initial rates of methane, acetate, formate, and dimethylsulfide formation increased differentially with increasing CO concentrations but were maximal already at the same moderate CO partial pressure. Strikingly, further increase of the amount of CO was not inhibitory. The maximal rate of methane formation from CO was approximately fivefold lower than that from methanol, consistent with the previously observed significant downregulation of the energy converting sodium-dependent methyltransferase. The rate of dimethylsulfide formation from CO was only 1-2{\%} of that of methane formation under any conditions tested. Implications of the data presented for previously proposed pathways of CO utilization are discussed.},

Single stage anaerobic digestion under thermophilic conditions is compared with two-stage anaerobic digestion (mesophilic digestion prior to thermophilic digestion). The comparison is in terms of solid reductions and specific methane productions. Fenton processed sludge gives higher solid reduction and higher methane production for each experiment. The highest reduction in sludge's solids was observed in a reactor operated under thermophilic conditions. The second stage digestion under mesophilic conditions did not induce extra solid reduction. However, it facilitated higher methane. Another observation is that, Fenton process led to decrease the biosolids' resistance to dewatering in terms of capillary suction time (CST), but had no effect on sludge dewatering on belt-press application.},

As determined by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, this organism was closely related to Methanococcus jannaschii strain JAL-1T. However, despite the high percentage of similarity between their 16S rDNA sequences (97.1{\%}), the DNA-DNA hybridization levels between these strains were less than 5{\%}. On the basis of these observations and physiological traits, it is proposed that this organism should be placed in a new species, Methanococcus vulcanius. The type strain is M7T (= DSM 12094T). During the course of this study, the 16S rDNA sequence analysis placed Methanococcus sp. strain AG86T (= DSM 4213T) as a close relative of M. jannaschii strain JAL-1T. However, the weak level of DNA-DNA hybridization with this strain ({\textless} 10{\%}) allowed the proposal that strain AG86T also constitutes a new species, Methanococcus fervens.},

High COD removal efficiencies were obtained in both control and supplemented UASB reactors (around 85{\%}). By adding 2 ml glycerol product per liter of raw wastewater, the biogas production could be increased by 0.74 l biogas ml−1 glycerol product, which leads to energy values in the range of 810–1270 kWhelectric per m3 product. Moreover, a better in-reactor biomass yield was observed for the supplemented UASB reactor (0.012 g VSS g−1 CODremoved) compared to the UASB control (0.002 g VSS g−1 CODremoved), which suggests a positive effect of glycerol on the sludge blanket growth.},

abstract = {A kinetic study was carried out on the anaerobic digestion of Olive Mill Wastewater (OMW) and OMW that was previously fermented with Geotrichum candidum, Azotobacter chroococcum and Aspergillus terreus. The bioreactor used was batch fed and contained sepiolite as support for the mediating bacteria. Experimental data observed for methane production (G) against time (t) are described by the following equation: G = GM[1 - exp( - Axt/S0), over the COD range studied (3.9-14.5 g/l), where: GM is the maximum methane volume obtained at the end of digestion time; S0 is the initial substrate concentration; X is the microorganism concentration and A is the kinetic constant of the process, which was calculated using a nonlinear regression. This kinetic parameter was found to be influenced by the pretreatment carried out, and was 4.6, 4.1 and 2.3 times higher for Aspergillus, Azotobacter and Geotrichum-pretreated OMW's than that obtained in the anaerobic digestion of untreated OMW. The kinetic constant increased when the phenolic compound content and biotoxicity of the pretreated-OMW's decreased. Finally, the yield coefficient, Tp, was 260 (untreated OMW), 300 (Geotrichum-pretreated OMW), 315 (Azotobacter-pretreated OMW) and 350 (Aspergillus-pretreated OMW) ml CH4 STP/g COD.},

The cells stained gram-negative, were 1.0-2.0 microm in diameter, were lysed by SDS and hypotonic solutions and were flagellated. Motility was not observed. The strain was able to use H2/CO2, 2-propanol/CO2, formate, 2-butanol/CO2 and cyclopentanol/CO2 as substrates for methanogenesis, but did not utilize acetate, ethanol, methanol or methylamines. The optimum temperature and pH were 25-30 degrees C and 6.7-7.2. Analysis of lipid component parts (core lipids, phospholipid polar head groups and glycolipid sugar moieties) showed the characteristic pattern of members of the family Methanomicrobiaceae except for the absence of glucose as a glycolipid sugar moiety. The G+C content of the DNA was 62.2 mol {\%}. Sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA revealed that the strain belonged to the genus Methanoculleus. The strain had DNA-DNA hybridization values of less than 50{\%} with type strains of Methanoculleus species. On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, the name Methanoculleus chikugoensis sp. nov. is proposed for strain MG62T (= JCM 10825T = DSM 13459T).

The cells were non-motile, Gram-negative and rod-shaped (1.8-2.4 microm long by 0.3-0.6 microm wide). Growth of strain SANAET was observed at 25-40 degrees C, with an optimum temperature range for growth of 35-37 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 6.5-7.8, with an optimum at pH 7.0. The salinity range for growth was 0-1 g NaCl l(-1) (0-17 mM). The isolate was able to utilize H2/CO2 and formate for growth and methane production. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.6 mol{\%}. Based on comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain SANAET was affiliated with a clone lineage of the Archaea, Rice Cluster I (RC-I), placing it between the orders Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales within the class 'Methanomicrobia'. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain SANAET and members of Methanosarcinales were in the range 80.0-82.8 {\%}, and those between the strain and members of Methanomicrobiales ranged from 77.5 to 82.4 {\%}. In addition to 16S rRNA gene analysis, sequence analysis of the mcrA gene (encoding the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, a key enzyme in the methane production pathway) also showed that strain SANAET was affiliated with the RC-I lineage. Here, we propose the name Methanocella paludicola gen. nov., sp. nov. for the isolate, the first of the RC-I lineage. The type strain is SANAET (=JCM 13418T=NBRC 101707T=DSM 17711T).

abstract = {The applicability of different kinetics to the hydrolysis of particulate organic material in anaerobic digestion is discussed. Hydrolysis has traditionally been modelled according to the first-order kinetics. For complex substrate, the first-order kinetics should be modified in order to take into account hardly degradable material. It has been shown that models in which hydrolysis is coupled to the growth of hydrolytic bacteria work well at high or at fluctuant organic loading. In particular, the surface-related two-phase and the Contois models showed good fits to experimental data from a wide range of organic waste. Both models tend to the first-order kinetics at a high biomass-to-waste ratio and, for this reason, they can be considered as more general models. Examples on different inhibition processes that might affect the degradation of solid waste are reported. Acetogenesis or methanogenesis might be the rate-limiting stages in complex waste. In such cases, stimulation of hydrolysis (mechanically, chemically or biologically) may lead to a further inhibition of these stages, which ultimately affects hydrolysis as well. Since the hydrolysis process is characterized by surface and transport phenomena, new developments in spatially distributed models are considered fundamental to provide new insights in this complex process.},

The cells were rods, 2.0-8.0 microm long and 0.40-0.45 microm wide, and stained Gram-negative. Optimal growth was observed at 28 degrees C and pH 7.0-7.2 and in 0.05 M NaCl. The isolate used H(2) plus CO(2), methylamine plus H(2) and methanol plus H(2) as sources for growth and methanogenesis. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain showed close affinity with Methanobacterium bryantii (similarity {\textgreater}99 {\%} to the type strain). On the basis of the level of DNA-DNA hybridization (62 {\%}) between strain MK4(T) and Methanobacterium bryantii VKM B-1629(T) and phenotypic and phylogenetic differences, strain MK4(T) was assigned to a novel species of the genus Methanobacterium, Methanobacterium veterum sp. nov., with the type strain MK4(T) (=DSM 19849(T) =VKM B-2440(T)).},

abstract = {Two trials were established to investigate the effect of recycled effluent on hydrolysis during anaerobic co-digestion of vegetable and flower waste. Trial I evaluated the effect by regulating the flow rate of recycled effluent, while Trial II regulated the ratio of hydrolytic effluent to methanogenic effluent, which were recycled to hydrolysis reactor. Results showed that the recirculation of methanogenic effluent could enhance the buffer capability and operation stability of hydrolysis reactor. Higher recycled flow rate was favourable for microbial anabolism and further promoted hydrolysis. After 9 days of hydrolysis, the cumulative SCOD in the hydrolytic effluent reached 334, 407, 413, 581 mg/g at recycled flow rates of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0m{\^{A}}{\l}/(m{\^{A}}{\l}{\^{A}}{\textperiodcentered}d), respectively. It was feasible to recycling a mixture of hydrolytic and methanogenic effluent to the hydrolysis reactor. This research showed that partially introducing hydrolytic effluent into the recycled liquid could enhance hydrolysis, while excessive recirculation of hydrolytic effluent will inhibit the hydrolysis. The flow ratio 1:3 of hydrolytic to methanogenic effluent was found to provide the highest hydrolysis efficiency and degradation rate of lignocelluloses-type biomass, among four ratios of 0:1, 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1. Under this regime, after 9 days of hydrolysis, the cumulative TOC and TN in the hydrolytic effluent reached 162 mg/g and 15 mg/g, the removal efficiency of TS, VS, C and cellulose in the solid phase were 60.66{\%}, 62.88{\%}, 58.35{\%} and 49.12{\%}, respectively. The flow ratio affected fermentation pathways, i.e. lower ratio favoured propionic acid fermentation and the generation of lactic acid while higher ratio promoted butyric acid fermentation.

The biomass was investigated at a molecular level to determine the links between the operational parameters of anaerobic digestion and methanogenic Archaea structure. The highest production of biogas with methane content of ca. 67{\%} was noted in the mesophilic microwave-heated reactors. The production of methane-rich biogas and the overall diversity of Archaea was determined by Methanosarcinaceae presence. The temperature and the application of microwaves were the main factors explaining the variations in the methanogen community. At 35°C, the microwave heating stimulated the growth of highly diverse methanogen assemblages, promoting Methanosarcina barkeri presence and excluding Methanosarcina harudinacea from the biomass. A temperature increase to 55°C lowered Methanosarcinaceae abundance and induced a replacement of Methanoculleus palmolei by Methanosarcina thermophila.},

Isolation from wetwood enrichment cultures, that were obtained from methane-positive trees, required a medium containing inorganic salts, vitamins, and an atmosphere consisting of an 80:20 mixture of hydrogen-carbon dioxide. Isolates of M. arbophilicum were gram-positive, non-motile short rods that occurred singly, in pairs, or chains. The organism was found to be an autotroph and a strick anaerobe, and to have a pH optimum of 7.5-8.0. The optimal temperature for growth was 30 to 37C, the maximum being 45C and the minimum about 10C. The organism had obligate growth requirements for H2 and CO2, and organic compounds greatly stimulated growth. The generation time in shake flask culture was about 17 hr in mineral salts medium and about 13 hr in complex medium. The DNA base composition was 27.5 mol {\%} GC.},

The 16S rRNA-based affiliation was supported by comparison of the mcrA gene, which encodes the alpha-subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase. Strain H2-LR(T) grew only on H(2)/CO(2). The DNA G+C content is 34.9 mol{\%}. Optimum growth temperature was 45 degrees C. The strain grew equally well at pH 7.5 and 8. No growth or methane production was observed below pH 5 or above pH 9. Strain H2-LR(T) grew well within an NaCl concentration range of 100 and 900 mM. No growth or methane production was observed at 1 M NaCl. At 50 mM NaCl, growth and methane production were reduced.

The results from the batch assays led to the addition of cobalt to reach a concentration of 0.2 mg L-1. This made it possible to increase the organic loading rate (OLR) above that in a parallel process not receiving any extra cobalt. Problems with low gas production and decreasing pH were overcome by the daily supply of this single element in small amounts. Acetate conversion to methane was improved, which was confirmed by increased specific methanogenic activity (SMA) with acetate as a substrate. As a consequence, an OLR of 7.0 g VS L-1 day-1 was achieved at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days with an equivalent increase in methane production. Without cobalt addition, an OLR of 5.0 g VS L-1 day-1 with an HRT of 20 days was reached after 70 weeks operation.},

The isolates were Gram-staining-variable, non-motile rods and grew only on H(2)/CO(2). Strain Mic6c05(T) produced methane from some alcohols without showing any growth; strain Mic5c12(T) did not utilize alcohols.

abstract = {Four formate-utilizing methanogens were isolated from ovine (strain KM1H5-1P(T)) and bovine (strains AK-87, OCP and ZA-10(T)) rumen contents. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the methanogen strains were found to belong to the order Methanobacteriales in the genus Methanobrevibacter. Strains ZA-10(T) and KM1H5-1P(T) gained energy for growth by the reduction of CO(2) to CH(4) using H(2) or formate exclusively as electron donors. Increasing formate concentrations to 220 mM in batch cultures increased the growth of strain KM1H5-1P(T) but did not affect the growth of strain ZA-10(T). Substrate specificity and resistance to cell-wall lysis supported the affiliation of the strains to the genus Methanobrevibacter. Strains ZA-10(T) and KM1H5-1P(T) showed 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.0 and 98.6 {\%} to their closest recognized relatives, Methanobrevibacter thaueri CW(T) and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium M1(T), respectively. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments indicated that the strains were not affiliated at the species level to their closest recognized relatives, with DNA reassociation values of only 28 {\%} between strains ZA-10(T) and Methanobrevibacter thaueri CW(T) and {\textless}25 {\%} between strains KM1H5-1P(T) and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium M1(T). Based on the data presented, the new strains are considered to represent two novel species of the genus Methanobrevibacter, for which the names Methanobrevibacter millerae sp. nov. (type strain ZA-10(T)=DSM 16643(T)=OCM 820(T)) and Methanobrevibacter olleyae sp. nov. (type strain KM1H5-1P(T)=DSM 16632(T)=OCM 841(T)) are proposed.},

abstract = {The isolation of a new methanogenic bacterium, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicus sp. n., is described. Successful isolation required a medium containing inorganic salts, an atmosphere consisting of an 80:20 mixture of hydrogen-carbon dioxide, and incubation temperatures of 65 to 70 C. Isolates of M. thermoautotrophicus were gram-positive, nonmotile, irregularly curved rods which frequently formed long filaments. The organism was found to be an autotroph and a strict anaerobe, and to have a pH optimum of 7.2 to 7.6. The optimal temperature for growth was 65 to 70 C, the maximum being 75 C and the minimum about 40 C. The generation time at the optimum was about 5 hr. The deoxyribonucleic acid of M. thermoautotrophicus had a guanine plus cytosine (GC) content of 52 moles per cent, whereas Methanobacterium sp. strain M.O.H. had a GC content of 38{\%}. When heated, intact ribosomes of Methanobacterium sp. strain M.O.H. were stable up to 55 C and had a Tm of 73 C. In contrast, ribosomes of M. thermoautotrophicus were stable up to 75 C and had a Tm of 82 C. Upon complete thermal denaturation, ribosomes of strain M.O.H. underwent a 59{\%} hyperchromic shift, whereas those of the thermophile showed only a 20{\%} increase in hyperchromicity. Methane formation in cell-free extracts of M. thermoautotrophicus was temperature-dependent and required hydrogen and carbon dioxide; methyl cobalamin served as a methyl donor, and addition of coenzyme M stimulated methanogenesis.},

Inhibition of anaerobic digestion is known to occur at high salt content. However, it seems that the suitable adaptation of an anaerobic sludge makes possible the treatment of saline wastewater. In this study, a non-saline anaerobic sludge was inoculated in two anaerobic batch reactors operating with a different substrate (distillery vinasse and ethanol) and subjected to increasing NaCl concentrations. The performance of the digesters appeared to be highly dependent on the nature of the substrate, and a similar level of inhibition (i.e. around 90{\%} of the specific loading rate and specific methanogenic activity) was stated at 10 g l(-1) of NaCl with distillery vinasse and 60 g l(-1) of NaCl with ethanol. The characterization of the microflora and its adaptation to increasing NaCl conditions were also investigated using molecular tools based on the analysis of genomic 16S rDNA. The microbial communities revealed a high diversity that could be maintained in both reactors despite the increase in NaCl concentrations.},

abstract = {In the present work, the main objective was to evaluate a biofiltration system for removing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) contained in a gaseous stream from an anaerobic digestor (AD). The elimination of these compounds allowed the potential use of biogas while maintaining the methane (CH4) content throughout the process. The biodegradation of H2S was determined in the lava rock biofilter under two different empty bed residence times (EBRT). Inlet loadings lower than 200 g/m3 h at an EBRT of 81 s yielded a complete removal, attaining an elimination capacity (EC) of 142 g/m3 h, whereas at an EBRT of 31 s, a critical EC of 200 g/m3 h was reached and the EC obtained exhibited a maximum value of 232 g/m3 h. For 1500 ppmv of H2S, 99{\%} removal was maintained during 90 days and complete biodegradation of VFAs was observed. A recovery of 60{\%} as sulfate was obtained due to the constant excess of O2 concentration in the system. Acetic and propionic acids as a sole source of carbon were also evaluated in the bioreactor at different inlet loadings (0-120 g/m3 h) obtaining a complete removal (99{\%}) for both. Microcosms biodegradation experiments conducted with VFAs demonstrated that acetic acid provided the highest biodegradation rate.},

Oxidation of methane, estimated from the flux of 13C to CO2 and microbial cells, occurred, but represented only 0.2-0.5{\%} of the methane produced. Methane oxidation was suppressed by the presence of oxygen, and was also inhibited by 2-bromoethane-sulphonate, and molybdate, but not by tungstate. CONCLUSION, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Methane could be oxidized anaerobically in the rumen by reverse methanogenesis in consort with sulphate reduction.},

abstract = {A series of molecular and geochemical studies were performed to study microbial, coal bed methane formation in the eastern Illinois Basin. Results suggest that organic matter is biodegraded to simple molecules, such as H(2) and CO(2), which fuel methanogenesis and the generation of large coal bed methane reserves. Small-subunit rRNA analysis of both the in situ microbial community and highly purified, methanogenic enrichments indicated that Methanocorpusculum is the dominant genus. Additionally, we characterized this methanogenic microorganism using scanning electron microscopy and distribution of intact polar cell membrane lipids. Phylogenetic studies of coal water samples helped us develop a model of methanogenic biodegradation of macromolecular coal and coal-derived oil by a complex microbial community. Based on enrichments, phylogenetic analyses, and calculated free energies at in situ subsurface conditions for relevant metabolisms (H(2)-utilizing methanogenesis, acetoclastic methanogenesis, and homoacetogenesis), H(2)-utilizing methanogenesis appears to be the dominant terminal process of biodegradation of coal organic matter at this location.},

In the paddy soil, 65–75{\%} of the radioactive glucose was converted to soluble metabolites. In the sediment, only about 25{\%} of the radioactive glucose was converted to soluble metabolites, the rest to particulate material. In anoxic paddy soil, the degradation pattern of position-labelled glucose was largely consistent with glucose degradation via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway followed by methanogenic acetate cleavage: CO2 mainly originated from C-3,4, whereas CH4 mainly originated from C-1 and C-6 of glucose. Acetate-carbon originated from C-1, C-2 and C-6 rather than from C-3,4 of glucose. In both paddy soil and Lake Constance sediment acetate and CO2 were the most important early metabolites of radioactive glucose. Other early products included propionate, ethanol/butyrate, succinate, and lactate, but accounted each for less than 1–8{\%} of the glucose utilized. The labelling of propionate by [3,4-14C]glucose suggests that it was mainly produced from glucose or lactate rather than from ethanol. Isopropanol and caproate were also detectable in paddy soil, but were not produced from radioactive glucose. Chloroform inhibited methanogenesis, inhibited the further degradation of radioactive acetate and resulted in the accumulation of H2, however, did not inhibit glucose degradation. Since acetate was the main soluble fermentation product of glucose and was produced at a relatively high molar acetate: CO2 ratio (2.5:1), homoacetogenesis appeared to be the most important glucose fermentation pathway.},

The effects of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and temperature variations on digesters performances were examined. At both 20 and 10 days biogas production for co-digestion was greater thanks to the improved balance of nutrients. The high specific gas productions for the different digestion processes were 0.56, 0.61 and 0.85 l g(-1) total volatile solids (TVS) removal for digesters treating AW, FVW and AW + FVW, respectively. At an HRT of 20 days, biogas production rates from thermophilic digesters were higher on average than from mesophilic AW, FVW and AW + FVW digestion by 28.5, 44.5 and 25{\%}, respectively. However, at 10 days of HRT results showed a decrease of biogas production rate for AW and AW + FVW digestion processes due to the high amount of free ammonia at high organic loading rate (OLR).},

abstract = {Syntrophic growth involves the oxidation of organic compounds and subsequent transfer of electrons to an H(2)- or formate-consuming micro-organism. In order to identify genes involved specifically in syntrophic growth, a mutant library of Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 was screened for loss of the ability to grow syntrophically with Methanospirillum hungatei JF-1. A collection of 20 mutants with an impaired ability to grow syntrophically was obtained. All 20 mutants grew in pure culture on lactate under sulfidogenic conditions at a rate and to a maximum OD(600) similar to those of the parental strain. The largest number of mutations that affected syntrophic growth with lactate was in genes encoding proteins involved in H(2) oxidation, electron transfer, hydrogenase post-translational modification, pyruvate degradation and signal transduction. The qrcB gene, encoding a quinone reductase complex (Qrc), and cycA, encoding the periplasmic tetrahaem cytochrome c(3) (TpIc(3)), were required by G20 to grow syntrophically with lactate. A mutant in the hydA gene, encoding an Fe-only hydrogenase (Hyd), is also impaired in syntrophic growth with lactate. The other mutants grew more slowly than the parental strain in syntrophic culture with M. hungatei JF-1. qrcB and cycA were shown previously to be required for growth of G20 pure cultures with H(2) and sulfate. Washed cells of the parental strain produced H(2) from either lactate or pyruvate, but washed cells of qrcB, cycA and hydA mutants produced H(2) at rates similar to the parental strain from pyruvate and did not produce significant amounts of H(2) from lactate. Real-time quantitative PCR assays showed increases in expression of the above three genes during syntrophic growth compared with pure-culture growth with lactate and sulfate. Our work shows that Hyd, Qrc and TpIc(3) are involved in H(2) production during syntrophic lactate metabolism by D. alaskensis G20 and emphasizes the importance of H(2) production for syntrophic lactate metabolism in this strain.},

abstract = {Transformations of 2-hydroxybenzoate and fluorobenzoate isomers were investigated in the strictly anaerobic Syntrophus aciditrophicus to gain insight into the initial steps of the metabolism of aromatic acids. 2-Hydroxybenzoate was metabolized to methane and acetate by S. aciditrophicus and Methanospirillum hungatei cocultures and reduced to cyclohexane carboxylate by pure cultures of S. aciditrophicus when grown in the presence of crotonate. Under both conditions, transient accumulation of benzoate but not phenol was observed, indicating that dehydroxylation occurred prior to ring reduction. Pure cultures of S. aciditrophicus reductively dehalogenated 3-fluorobenzoate with the stoichiometric accumulation of benzoate and fluorine. 3-Fluorobenzoate-degrading cultures produced a metabolite that had a fragmentation pattern almost identical to that of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivative of 3-fluorobenzoate but with a mass increase of 2 units. When cells were incubated with deuterated water, this metabolite had a mass increase of 3 or 4 units relative to the TMS derivative of 3-fluorobenzoate. (19)F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((19)F NMR) detected a metabolite in fluorobenzoate-degrading cultures with two double bonds, either 1-carboxyl-3-fluoro-2,6-cyclohexadiene or 1-carboxyl-3-fluoro-3,6-cyclohexadiene. The mass spectral and NMR data are consistent with the addition of two hydrogen or deuterium atoms to 3-fluorobenzoate, forming a 3-fluorocyclohexadiene metabolite. The production of a diene metabolite provides evidence that S. aciditrophicus contains dearomatizing reductase that uses two electrons to dearomatize the aromatic ring.},

Studies with 14C-labelled substrates showed that the amount of labelled methane formed from 1-14C-labelled acetate was equal to that formed from 2-14C-labelled acetate. Labelled methane was also formed from H14CO3-. These results clearly showed that both the methyl and carboxyl groups of acetate were oxidized to CO2 and that CO2 was reduced to CH4 through hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. During growth of the triculture, a significant isotopic exchange between the carboxyl group of acetate and bicarbonate occurred. As a result, there was a decrease in the specific activity of 1-14C-acetate, and the production of 14CO2 was slightly higher from 1-14C- than from 2-14C-acetate. For each mole acetate degraded, 0.94 mol methane was formed; 9.2 mmol acetate was metabolized during the 294 days of incubation.},

abstract = {In biofilm environments, heavy metal and radionuclide pollutants are removed by a variety of mechanisms, including biosorption, precipitation as sulfides or phosphates and microbial reductive precipitation. Even if the elemental composition and localization of the precipitate trapped in the biofilm is well described thanks to spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, this review highlights that little is known about metal immobilisation mechanisms in microbial biofilms, i.e., mass transfer of metals, mechanisms involved in (bio)sorption and precipitation and the influence of physicochemical micro-environments within the biofilm matrix. The review shows the advantage of using a combination of different techniques to evaluate the fate of metals within microbial biofilms. By combining a variety of techniques (e.g., selective extraction, microscopy, spectroscopy and miniaturised sensors ...), it is possible to gain high-resolution structural and chemical information of biofilms on a level of the individual cell. This approach will facilitate the characterization of the metal immobilisation sites and the metal sorption and (bio)crystallisation mechanisms in biofilms. The results provided by the combination of these techniques will allow to predict the amount of metal accumulation in biofilms as well as their chemical speciation. This review demonstrates that an interdisciplinary approach is required to study metal fate within the biofilm matrix.},

The reactor performance was determined in terms of methane production, volatile fatty acids conversion and chemical oxygen demand reduction. At a constant influent strength, the methane production rate (litres CH4g-1 COD day-1) decreased with decreasing hydraulic retention time. At constant hydraulic retention time the methane production rate increased as the influent strength was increased up to a concentration of 28{\textperiodcentered}8 g COD litre-1. The methane production rate was similar for two influent concentrations studied at hydraulic retention times longer than 10 days. The effect of short hydraulic retention times on methane production rate was more pronounced for the higher influent concentration than for the lower influent concentration. The highest methane production rate of 9{\textperiodcentered}57 litres CH4 litre-1 feed day-1 was obtained at a loading rate of 5{\textperiodcentered}96 g-1 COD litre-1 and an influent concentration of 28{\textperiodcentered}8 g COD litre-1. A high treatment efficiency in terms of chemical oxygen demand reduction was obtained. In general, over 98{\%} removal of chemical oxygen demand was achieved. The results indicated that anaerobic digestion of cheese whey using an up-flow sludge blanket reactor could reduce pollution strength and produce energy for a cheese plant.},

abstract = {Cheese whey was treated in a 17{\textperiodcentered}5-litre laboratory-scale up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor operated over a range of hydraulic retention times and organic loading rates. The reactor performance was determined in terms of methane production, volatile fatty acids conversion and chemical oxygen demand reduction. At a constant influent strength, the methane production rate (litres CH4g-1 COD day-1) decreased with decreasing hydraulic retention time. At constant hydraulic retention time the methane production rate increased as the influent strength was increased up to a concentration of 28{\textperiodcentered}8 g COD litre-1. The methane production rate was similar for two influent concentrations studied at hydraulic retention times longer than 10 days. The effect of short hydraulic retention times on methane production rate was more pronounced for the higher influent concentration than for the lower influent concentration. The highest methane production rate of 9{\textperiodcentered}57 litres CH4 litre-1 feed day-1 was obtained at a loading rate of 5{\textperiodcentered}96 g-1 COD litre-1 and an influent concentration of 28{\textperiodcentered}8 g COD litre-1. A high treatment efficiency in terms of chemical oxygen demand reduction was obtained. In general, over 98{\%} removal of chemical oxygen demand was achieved. The results indicated that anaerobic digestion of cheese whey using an up-flow sludge blanket reactor could reduce pollution strength and produce energy for a cheese plant.},

abstract = {We generated draft genome sequences for two cold-adapted Archaea, Methanogenium frigidum and Methanococcoides burtonii, to identify genotypic characteristics that distinguish them from Archaea with a higher optimal growth temperature (OGT). Comparative genomics revealed trends in amino acid and tRNA composition, and structural features of proteins. Proteins from the cold-adapted Archaea are characterized by a higher content of noncharged polar amino acids, particularly Gln and Thr and a lower content of hydrophobic amino acids, particularly Leu. Sequence data from nine methanogen genomes (OGT 15 degrees -98 degrees C) were used to generate 1111 modeled protein structures. Analysis of the models from the cold-adapted Archaea showed a strong tendency in the solvent-accessible area for more Gln, Thr, and hydrophobic residues and fewer charged residues. A cold shock domain (CSD) protein (CspA homolog) was identified in M. frigidum, two hypothetical proteins with CSD-folds in M. burtonii, and a unique winged helix DNA-binding domain protein in M. burtonii. This suggests that these types of nucleic acid binding proteins have a critical role in cold-adapted Archaea. Structural analysis of tRNA sequences from the Archaea indicated that GC content is the major factor influencing tRNA stability in hyperthermophiles, but not in the psychrophiles, mesophiles or moderate thermophiles. Below an OGT of 60 degrees C, the GC content in tRNA was largely unchanged, indicating that any requirement for flexibility of tRNA in psychrophiles is mediated by other means. This is the first time that comparisons have been performed with genome data from Archaea spanning the growth temperature extremes from psychrophiles to hyperthermophiles.},

Acetate utilization was found to be the rate-limiting reaction for complete degradation of butyrate to methane and carbon dioxide in continuous culture. Increasing the dilution rate resulted in a gradual accumulation of acetate. The results explain the low concentrations of butyrate and hydrogen normally found during anaerobic digestion and the observation that acetate is the first volatile fatty acid to accumulate upon a decrease in retention time or increase in organic loading of a digestor.},

Activity was estimated by supplying sufficient substrate (acetate, propionate, butyrate, H2 or none) to saturate the catabolic systems of the various physiological groups, whereafter the specific methane production rate was determined. Activity was defined as the substrate-dependent methane production rate per unit mass of volatile solids biomass, i.e. the rate with a saturating concentration of substrate present when the background methane production rate had been diluted to an insignificant level. When the digestor was perturbed, the concentration of unused substrate in the biomass obscured the effect of added substrates on the test batches. It was generally found that if the background level of substrates could not be sufficiently lowered by dilution, substrate specific activity tests, as commonly described in the literature, were useless.},

abstract = {Two lab-scale, mesophilic anaerobic digesters (namely reactors R-1 and R-2) were operated simultaneously for continuous production of biogas from fodder beet silage as monosubstrate. The digesters were operated by a control system, developed at HAW Hamburg, which allowed an automatic auto-feeding up to a given maximum set-point. Within a period of 400 days of investigation, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) for reactor R-1 was adjusted to 10–12.5 days, and for reactor R-2, only to 6 days. The organic loading rate (OLR) varied with the total solids (TS) content of the harvest charge, ranging between 3.5 and 5 kg VS m 3 d 1. Although both digesters were run under stable conditions, indicated by low volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentrations below 200 mg l 1, the specific gas production rate (spec. GPR) declined over time to 0.55 and 0.40 l g VS 1 d 1, for R-1 and R-2, respectively. Therefore, it seemed that some nutrients were deprived, particularly in reactor R-2, which had a short HRT of 6 days. After supplementation with phosphate and sulphate, the improvement of the spec. GPR was 11{\%} for reactor R-1, and 20{\%} for reactor R-2. Simultaneously performed anaerobic batch digestion test series with the beet silage also confirmed the positive effect of these nutrients on the spec. GPR. Furthermore, quantitative microscopic counts exhibited that the addition of these nutrients had no significant effect on the performance of reactor R-1, but the number of the fluorescent methanogenic bacteria increased four-fold in the high throughput reactor R-2, after supplementation with phosphate. However, additional supplementation with sulphate had no further effect on the performance of R-2. Therefore, phosphate seems to be the limiting macro-nutrient for anaerobic digestion of fodder beet silage, especially under high loading conditions.},

No significant differences in Km values for butyrate degradation were found between chemostat- and batch-grown tricultures, although the maximum growth rate was somewhat higher in the batch cultures in which the medium was supplemented with yeast extract. Acetate utilization was found to be the rate-limiting reaction for complete degradation of butyrate to methane and carbon dioxide in continuous culture. Increasing the dilution rate resulted in a gradual accumulation of acetate. The results explain the low concentrations of butyrate and hydrogen normally found during anaerobic digestion and the observation that acetate is the first volatile fatty acid to accumulate upon a decrease in retention time or increase in organic loading of a digestor.},

abstract = {Two lab-scale, mesophilic anaerobic digesters (namely reactors R-1 and R-2) were operated simultaneously for continuous production of biogas from fodder beet silage as monosubstrate. The digesters were operated by a control system, developed at HAW Hamburg, which allowed an automatic auto-feeding up to a given maximum set-point. Within a period of 400 days of investigation, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) for reactor R-1 was adjusted to 10–12.5 days, and for reactor R-2, only to 6 days. The organic loading rate (OLR) varied with the total solids (TS) content of the harvest charge, ranging between 3.5 and 5 kg VS m 3 d 1. Although both digesters were run under stable conditions, indicated by low volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentrations below 200 mg l 1, the specific gas production rate (spec. GPR) declined over time to 0.55 and 0.40 l g VS 1 d 1, for R-1 and R-2, respectively. Therefore, it seemed that some nutrients were deprived, particularly in reactor R-2, which had a short HRT of 6 days. After supplementation with phosphate and sulphate, the improvement of the spec. GPR was 11{\%} for reactor R-1, and 20{\%} for reactor R-2. Simultaneously performed anaerobic batch digestion test series with the beet silage also confirmed the positive effect of these nutrients on the spec. GPR. Furthermore, quantitative microscopic counts exhibited that the addition of these nutrients had no significant effect on the performance of reactor R-1, but the number of the fluorescent methanogenic bacteria increased four-fold in the high throughput reactor R-2, after supplementation with phosphate. However, additional supplementation with sulphate had no further effect on the performance of R-2. Therefore, phosphate seems to be the limiting macro-nutrient for anaerobic digestion of fodder beet silage, especially under high loading conditions.},

abstract = {The diversity, population dynamics, and activity profiles of methanogens in anaerobic granular sludges from two anaerobic hybrid reactors treating a molasses wastewater both mesophilically (37 degrees C) and thermophilically (55 degrees C) during a 1081 day trial were determined. The influent to one of the reactors was supplemented with sulphate, after an acclimation period of 112 days, to determine the effect of competition with sulphate-reducing bacteria on the methanogenic community structure. Sludge samples were removed from the reactors at intervals throughout the operational period and examined by amplified ribosomal DNA (rDNA) restriction analysis (ARDRA) and partial sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. In total, 18 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, 12 of which were sequenced. The methanogenic communities in both reactors changed during the operational period. The seed sludge and the reactor biomass sampled during mesophilic operation, both in the presence and absence of sulphate, was characterised by a predominance of Methanosaeta spp. Following temperature elevation, the dominant methanogenic sequences detected in the non-sulphate supplemented reactor were closely related to Methanocorpusculum parvum. By contrast, the dominant OTUs detected in the sulphate-supplemented reactor upon temperature increase were related to the hydrogen-utilising methanogen, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. The observed methanogenic community structure in the reactors correlated with the operational performance of the reactors during the trial and with physiological measurements of the reactor biomass. Both reactors achieved chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies of over 90{\%} during mesophilic operation, with or without sulphate supplementation. During thermophilic operation, the presence of sulphate resulted in decreased reactor performance (effluent acetate concentrations of {\textgreater}3000 mg/l and biogas methane content of {\textless}25{\%}). It was demonstrated that methanogenic conversion of acetate at 55 degrees C was extremely sensitive to inhibition by sulphide (50{\%} inhibition at 8-17 mg/l unionised sulphide at pH 7.6-8.0), while the conversion of H(2)/CO(2) methanogenically was favoured. The combination of experiments carried out demonstrated the presence of specific methanogenic populations during periods of successful operational performance.},

abstract = {A study of the second step or methanogenic stage of a two-stage anaerobic digestion process treating two-phase olive oil mill solid residue (OMSR) was conducted at mesophilic temperature (35 degrees C). The substrate fed to the methanogenic step was the effluent from a hydrolytic-acidogenic reactor operating at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 12.9 g chemical oxygen demand (COD) L(-1) d(-1) and at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12.4 days; these OLR and HRT were found to be the best values to achieve the maximum total volatile fatty acid concentration (14.5 g L(-1) expressed as acetic acid) with a high concentration in acetic acid (57.5{\%} of the total concentration) as the principal precursor of methane. The methanogenic stage was carried out in an anaerobic stirred tank reactor containing saponite as support media for the immobilization of microorganisms. OLRs of between 0.8 and 22.0 g COD L(-1) d(-1) were studied. These OLRs corresponded to HRTs of between 142.9 and 4.6 days. The methanogenic reactor operated with high stability for OLRs lower than 20.0 g COD L(-1) d(-1). This behaviour was shown by the total volatile fatty acids/total alkalinity ratio, whose values were always kept 0.12 for HRTs{\textgreater}4.6 days. The total COD (T-COD) removed was in the range of 94.3-61.3{\%} and the volatile solids (VS) removed between 92.8{\%} and 56.1{\%} for OLRs between 0.8 and 20.0 g COD L(-1) d(-1). In the same way, a reduction of 43.8{\%} was achieved for phenolic content. The low concentration of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) observed (below 1 g L(-1) expressed as CH(3)COOH) in the methanogenic reactor effluents showed the high percentage of consumption and conversion of these acids to methane. A methane yield of 0.268+/-0.003 L CH(4) at standard temperature and pressure conditions (STP) g(-1) COD eliminated was achieved.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that rice paddy fields (RPFs) are contributing 10 to 25{\%} of global methane emissions, the organisms responsible for methane production in RPFs have remained uncultivated and thus uncharacterized. Here we report the isolation of a methanogen (strain SANAE) belonging to an abundant and ubiquitous group of methanogens called rice cluster I (RC-I) previously identified as an ecologically important microbial component via culture-independent analyses. To enrich the RC-I methanogens from rice paddy samples, we attempted to mimic the in situ conditions of RC-I on the basis of the idea that methanogens in such ecosystems should thrive by receiving low concentrations of substrate (H2) continuously provided by heterotrophic H2-producing bacteria. For this purpose, we developed a coculture method using an indirect substrate (propionate) in defined medium and a propionate-oxidizing, H2-producing syntroph, Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans, as the H2 supplier. By doing so, we significantly enriched the RC-I methanogens and eventually obtained a methanogen within the RC-I group in pure culture. This is the first report on the isolation of a methanogen within RC-I.},

abstract = {A ferredoxin has been isolated from the thermophilic methanogen Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus. The native protein was a monomer exhibiting a molecular weight of 7,262, calculated from the amino acid composition. Its absorption spectrum had two maxima at 390 and 283 nm, with an absorbance ratio A390/A283 of 0.79. The absorption at 390 nm (E = 29 mM-1 cm-1) and the content of iron of the protein are in agreement with the presence of two 4Fe-4S clusters in M. thermolithotrophicus ferredoxin. Its amino acid composition showed the presence of eight cysteine residues, which is the required number of cysteines for the binding of two 4Fe-4S clusters. The protein was characterized by the lack of histidine, arginine, and leucine and a high content of valine. It was unusually stable to high temperatures but not to oxygen. The ESR spectrum of the protein in the oxidized state showed a minor signal at g = 2.01, corresponding to an oxidized 3Fe-4S cluster. The protein, which was difficult to reduce with dithionite or reduced mediators, exhibited in its reduced state a spectrum typical of two interacting reduced 4Fe-4S clusters. M. thermolithotrophicus ferredoxin functioned as an electron acceptor for the CO dehydrogenase complex with an extract free of ferredoxin. No reaction was detected with F420 or hydrogenase.},

abstract = {We isolated a methanogen from deep in the sediments of the Nankai Trough off the eastern coast of Japan. At the sampling site, the water was 950 m deep and the sediment core was collected at 247 m below the sediment surface. The isolated methanogen was named Nankai-1. Cells of Nankai-1 were nonmotile and highly irregular coccoids (average diameter, 0.8 to 2 micro m) and grew with hydrogen or formate as a catabolic substrate. Cells required acetate as a carbon source. Yeast extract and peptones were not required but increased the growth rate. The cells were mesophilic, growing most rapidly at 45 degrees C (no growth at {\textless}/=10 degrees C or {\textgreater}/=55 degrees C). Cells grew with a maximum specific growth rate of 2.43 day(-1) at 45 degrees C. Cells grew at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7 but did not grow at pH 4.7 or 9.0. Strain Nankai-1 grew in a wide range of salinities, from 0.1 to 1.5 M Na(+). The described phenotypic characteristics of this novel isolate were consistent with the in situ environment of the Nankai Trough. This is the first report of a methanogenic isolate from methane hydrate-bearing sediments. Phylogenetic analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that it is most closely related to Methanoculleus marisnigri (99.1{\%} sequence similarity), but DNA hybridization experiments indicated a DNA sequence similarity of only 49{\%}. Strain Nankai-1 was also found to be phenotypically similar to M. marisnigri, but two major phenotypic differences were found: strain Nankai-1 does not require peptones, and it grows fastest at a much higher temperature. We propose a new species, Methanoculleus submarinus, with strain Nankai-1 as the type strain.},

@article{Wagner2011,
abstract = {Since biogas production is becoming increasingly important the understanding of anaerobic digestion processes is fundamental. However, large-scale digesters often lack online sensor equipment to monitor key parameters. Furthermore the possibility to selectively change fermenting parameter settings in order to investigate methane output or microbial changes is limited. In the present study we examined the possibility to investigate the microbial community of a large scale (750,000 L) digester within a laboratory small-scale approach. We studied the short-term response of the downscaled communities on various fatty acids and its effects on gas production and compared it with data from the original digester sludge. Even high loads of formic acid led to distinct methane formation, whereas high concentrations of other acids (acetic, butyric, propionic acid) caused a marked inhibition of methanogenesis coupled with an increase in hydrogen concentration. Molecular microbial techniques (DGGE/quantitative real-time-PCR) were used to monitor the microbial community changes which were related to data from GC and HPLC analysis. DGGE band patterns showed that the same microorganisms which were already dominant in the original digester re-established again in the lab-scale experiment. Very few microorganisms dominated the whole fermenting process and species diversity was not easily influenced by moderate varying fatty acid amendments--Methanoculleus thermophilus being the most abundant species throughout the variants. MCR-copy number determined via quantitative real-time-PCR--turned out to be a reliable parameter for quantification of methanogens, even in a very complex matrix like fermenter sludge. Generally the downscaled batch approach was shown to be appropriate to investigate microbial communities from large-scale digesters.},

The methods of pretreatment studied are NaOH addition (chemical), heating (thermal) and heating with NaOH addition (thermochemical) to the domestic WAS and to the combined WAS from domestic, commercial and industrial wastewaters. The thermochemical pretreatment gave the best result among three methods in the combined WAS, i.e., the VSS was solubilized by 40–50{\%} and the methane production incresed by more than 200{\%} over the control when the WAS was heated at 130 °C for 5 minutes with the dose 0.3 g NaOH/g VSS. In the domestic WAS, the VSS solubilization rate was 70–80{\%} but the increase of the methane production was about 30{\%} after thermochemically pretreated. The domestic WAS consists of 41{\%} protein, 25{\%} lipid and 14{\%} carbohydrate on COD basis, and the solubilization rate of protein, which is the largest constituent of the WAS, was 63{\%} in the thermochemical pretreatment. Although the effect of the thermochemical pretreatment on the methane production was higher to the combined WAS than to the domestic WAS, the methane production rate was 21.9 ml CH4/g VSSwas{\textperiodcentered}day in the domestic WAS and 12.8 ml CH4/g VSSwas{\textperiodcentered}day in the combined WAS. },

Both compounds are novel cyclic lipopeptides with a palmitic acid connected to the terminal amino group of eighth amino acid in peptide moiety. The C-terminal carboxylic group of the last amino acid (Val or Leu) forms a lactone with the hydroxyl of Thr3. Pseudofactin II reduced the surface tension of water from 72{\&}{\#}xa0;mN/m to 31.5{\&}{\#}xa0;mN/m at a concentration of 72{\&}{\#}xa0;mg/l.

abstract = {There is a large, unutilised energy potential in agricultural waste fractions. In this pilot-scale study, the efficiency of a simple two-stage anaerobic digestion process was investigated for stabilisation and biomethanation of solid potato waste and sugar beet leaves, both separately and in co-digestion. A good phase separation between hydrolysis/acidification and methanogenesis was achieved, as indicated by the high carbon dioxide production, high volatile fatty acid concentration and low pH in the acidogenic reactors. Digestion of the individual substrates gave gross energy yields of 2.1–3.4 kWh/kg VS in the form of methane. Co-digestion, however, gave up to 60{\%} higher methane yield, indicating that co-digestion resulted in improved methane production due to the positive synergism established in the digestion liquor. The integrity of the methane filters (MFs) was maintained throughout the period of operation, producing biogas with 60–78{\%} methane content. A stable effluent pH showed that the methanogenic reactors had good ability to withstand the variations in load and volatile fatty acid concentrations that occurred in the two-stage process. The results of this pilot-scale study show that the two-stage anaerobic digestion system is suitable for effective conversion of semi-solid agricultural residues as potato waste and sugar beet leaves},

abstract = {Five strains of methanogenic archaea (MT, MS, MM, MSP, ZB) were isolated from permanently and periodically cold terrestrial habitats. Physiological and morphological studies, as well as phylogenetic analyses of the new isolates were performed. Based on sequences of the 16S rRNA and methyl-coenzyme M reductase a-subunit (mcrA) genes all new isolates are closely related to known mesophilic and psychrotolerant methanogens. Both, phylogenetic analyses and phenotypic properties allow to classify strains MT, MS, and MM as members of the genus Methanosarcina. Strain MT is a new ecotype of Methanosarcina mazei, whereas strains MM and MS are very similar to each other and can be assigned to the recently described psychrotolerant species Methanosarcina lacustris. The hydrogenotrophic strain MSP is a new ecotype of the genus Methanocorpusculum. The obligately methylotrophic strain ZB is closely related to Methanomethylovorans hollandica and can be classified as new ecotype of this species. All new isolates, including the strains from permanently cold environments, are not true psychrophiles according to their growth temperature characteristics. In spite of the ability of all isolates to grow at temperatures as low as 1-5 degrees C, all of them have their growth optima in the range of moderate temperatures (25-35 degrees C). Thus, they can be regarded as psychrotolerant organisms. Psychrotolerant methanogens are thought to play an important role in methane production in both, habitats under seasonal temperature variations or from permanently cold areas.},

In these environments, the dominant thermophilic methanogens were generally related to uncultured organisms of the genus Methanothermobacter. Here we isolated two representative strains, Tm2(T) and HMD, from the oil sands and oil production water in the Shengli oil field in the People's Republic of China. The type strain, Tm2(T), was nonmotile and stained Gram positive. The cells were straight to slightly curved rods (0.3 $\mu$m in width and 2.2 to 5.9 $\mu$m in length), but some of them possessed a coccal shape connecting with the rods at the ends. Strain Tm2(T) grew with H(2)-CO(2), but acetate is required. Optimum growth of strain Tm2(T) occurred in the presence of 0.025 g/liter NaCl at pH 6.9 and a temperature of 65°C. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 40.1 mol{\%} ± 1.3 mol{\%} (by the thermal denaturation method) or 41.1 mol{\%} (by high-performance liquid chromatography). Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that Tm2(T) was most closely related to Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus $\Delta$H(T) and Methanothermobacter wolfeii VKM B-1829(T) (both with a sequence similarity of 96.4{\%}). Based on these phenotypic and phylogenic characteristics, a novel species was proposed and named Methanothermobacter crinale sp. nov. The type strain is Tm2(T) (ACCC 00699(T) = JCM 17393(T)).},

Strains AK-4 (=OCM 774), AK-5T (=OCM 775T=DSM 17273T) and AK-9 (=OCM 793) were isolated from the sulfate-reducing zone of the sediments. Each of the strains was a non-motile coccus and occurred singly. Cells grew with trimethylamine as a catabolic substrate and strain AK-4 could also catabolize methanol. Yeast extract and trypticase peptones were not required for growth, but their addition to the culture medium slightly stimulated growth. Each of the strains grew at temperatures of 5-28 degrees C; they were slight halophiles and grew fastest in the neutral pH range. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain AK-4 was most closely related to Methanosarcina baltica. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed 88 {\%} relatedness, suggesting that strain AK-4 represents a novel strain within this species. Strains AK-5T and AK-9 had identical 16S rRNA gene sequences that were most closely related to the sequence of Methanococcoides burtonii (99.8 {\%} sequence similarity). DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed that strains AK-5T and AK-9 are members of the same species (88 {\%} relatedness value), but strain AK-5T had a DNA-DNA relatedness value of only 55 {\%} to Methanococcoides burtonii. This indicates that strains AK-5T and AK-9 should be considered as members of a novel species in the genus Methanococcoides. We propose the name Methanococcoides alaskense sp. nov., with strain AK-5T (=OCM 775T=DSM 17273T) as the type strain.},

Acid hydrolysis of this compound with 6 m HCl for 24 hr releases a ninhydrin-positive compound (glutamic acid), an acid-stable chromophore, phosphate, and an ether-soluble phenolic component. Factor(420) may be reduced by either sodium dithionite or sodium borohydride at pH 7.3 with concomitant loss of its fluorescence and its major absorption peak at 420 nm. Crude cell-free extracts of strain M.o.H. reduce F(420) only under a hydrogen atmosphere. F(420) is photolabile aerobically in neutral and basic solutions, whereas the acid-stable chromophore is not photolabile under these conditions. An approximate molecular weight of 630 +/- 8{\%} for F(420) was determined by Sephadex G-25 chromatography. At the present time, F(420) is proposed as a trivial name for the unknown fluorescent compound because of its strong absorption maximum of 420 nm at pH 7.},

abstract = {Since biogas production is becoming increasingly important the understanding of anaerobic digestion processes is fundamental. However, large-scale digesters often lack online sensor equipment to monitor key parameters. Furthermore the possibility to selectively change fermenting parameter settings in order to investigate methane output or microbial changes is limited. In the present study we examined the possibility to investigate the microbial community of a large scale (750,000 L) digester within a laboratory small-scale approach. We studied the short-term response of the downscaled communities on various fatty acids and its effects on gas production and compared it with data from the original digester sludge. Even high loads of formic acid led to distinct methane formation, whereas high concentrations of other acids (acetic, butyric, propionic acid) caused a marked inhibition of methanogenesis coupled with an increase in hydrogen concentration. Molecular microbial techniques (DGGE/quantitative real-time-PCR) were used to monitor the microbial community changes which were related to data from GC and HPLC analysis. DGGE band patterns showed that the same microorganisms which were already dominant in the original digester re-established again in the lab-scale experiment. Very few microorganisms dominated the whole fermenting process and species diversity was not easily influenced by moderate varying fatty acid amendments--Methanoculleus thermophilus being the most abundant species throughout the variants. MCR-copy number determined via quantitative real-time-PCR--turned out to be a reliable parameter for quantification of methanogens, even in a very complex matrix like fermenter sludge. Generally the downscaled batch approach was shown to be appropriate to investigate microbial communities from large-scale digesters.},

abstract = {Anaerobic digestion of cheese whey wastewaters (CW) was investigated in a system consisting of an ecological pretreatment followed by upflow anaerobic filter (UAF). The pretreatment was conducted to solve the inhibition problems during anaerobic treatment of CW caused by the amounts of fats, proteins and carbohydrates and to avoid the major problems of clogging in the reactor. The optimized ecological pretreatment of diluted CW induce removal yields of 50{\%} of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 60{\%} of total suspended solids (TSS) after acidification by Lactobacillus paracasei at 32 °C during 20 h and neutralization with lime. The pretreated CW was used to feed UAF (35 °C). The effects of organic loading rate (OLR) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on the pretreated CW anaerobic degradation were examined. The average total COD removals achieved was 80-90{\%}. The performance of the reactor was depressed by increasing the COD concentration to 20 g/l (OLR = 4 g COD/l d) and the COD removal efficiency was reduced to 72{\%}. Significant methane yield (280 l/kg COD removal) was obtained at an HRT of 2 days.},

The isolate grew at temperatures between 15° C and 45° C with the optimum at around 37° C. Acetate, yeast extract and tungstate were required in the medium. Clarified rumen fluid stimulated growth. The DNA of the new methanogen has a G+C content of 48.5 mol{\%}. Comparative 16 S rRNA oligonucleotide cataloguing allows to define the new isolate as a member of a new genus of the order Methanomicrobiales. Further evidence for this is provided by the antigenic crossreactivity with anti-S probes and by metabolic features. Because of its small size the new methanogen is named Methanocorpusculum parvum.},

abstract = {An enrichment culture which converted acetate to methane at 60°C was obtained from a thermophilic anaerobic bioreactor. The predominant morphotype in the enrichment was a sheathed gas-vacuolated rod with marked resemblence to the mesophile Methanothrix soehngenii. This organism was isolated using vancomycin treatments and serial dilutions and was named Methanothrix sp. strain CALS-1. Strain CALS-1 grew as filaments typically 2–5 cells long, and cultures showed opalescent turbidity rather than macroscopic clumps. The cells were enclosed in a striated subunit-type sheath and there were distinct cross-walls between the cells, similar to M. soehngenii. The gas vesicles in cells were typically 70 nm in diameter and up to 0.5 µm long, and were collapsed by pressures over 3 atm (ca. 300 kPa). Stationary-phase cells tended to have a higher vesicle content than did growing cells, and occasionally bands of cells were seen floating at the top of the liquid in stationary-phase cultures. Acetate was the only substrate of those tested which was used for methanogenesis by strain CALS-1, and acetate was decarboxylated by the aceticlastic reaction. The optimum temperature for growth of strain CALS-1 was near 60°C (doubling time=24–26 h), with no growth occurring at 70°C and 37°C. The optimum pH value for growth was near 6.5 in bicarbonate/CO2 buffered medium and no growth occurred at pH 5.5 or pH 8.4. No growth was obtained below pH 7 when the medium was buffered with 20 mM phosphate. Strain CALS-1 grew in a chemically defined medium and required biotin. Sulfide concentrations over 1 mM were inhibitory to the culture, and growth was more rapid with 1 mM 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (coenzyme M) or 1 mM titanium citrate as an accessory reductant than with 1 mM cysteine. It is likely that strain CALS-1 represents a new species in the genus Methanothrix.},

abstract = {We continuously fed an anaerobic chemostat with synthetic wastewater containing glucose as the sole source of carbon and energy to study the effects of temperature on the microbial community under hyperthermophilic (65-80 degrees C) conditions. Methane was produced normally up to 77.5 degrees C at a dilution rate of 0.025 d(-1). However, the concentration of microorganisms and the rate of gas production decreased with increasing operation temperature. The microbial community in the chemostat at various temperatures was analyzed based on the 16S rRNA gene using molecular biological techniques including clone library analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Aceticlastic methanogens related to Methanosarcina thermophila were detected at 65 degrees C and hydrogenotrophilic methanogens related to Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus were the dominant methanogens between 70 degrees C to 77.5 degrees C. Bacteria related to Clostridium stercorarium and Thermoanaerobacter subterraneus comprised the dominant glucose-fermenting bacteria at temperatures of 65 degrees C and above, respectively. Bacteria related to Thermacetogenium phaeum and to Tepidiphilus margaritifer and Petrobacter succinatimandens were the dominant acetate-oxidizing bacteria at 70 degrees C and at 75-77.5 degrees C, respectively. The results suggested that, at temperatures of 70 degrees C and above, methane production via the aceticlastic pathway was negligible and indirect methanogenesis from acetate was dominant. Since acetate oxidation is a rate limiting step and a higher temperature favors the hydrolysis and acid formation, a two stage fermentation process, acidogenic and methanogenic fermentation stages operated under different temperatures, should be more suitable for the thermophilic anaerobic treatment at temperatures above 65 degrees C.},

abstract = {Strain DX01, a thermophilic methanogen, was isolated from a hot spring in China. Strain DX01 grew only on H2/CO2. The DNA G+C content is 52 mol{\%} and optimal growth temperature is 65 degrees C. The cell pellet is brick red. By analyzing 16S rRNA sequence, methyl-coenzyme M reductase I, gamma subunit protein sequences, we determined the DX01 strain to be closely related to the species of Methanothermobacter marburgensis. In addition, Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus delta H(T) and strain DX01 had clear differences in their biochemical composition and protein expression profiles. Based on the above analysis, we propose that strain DX01 is a novel strain within thermoautotrophicus the species of M. marburgensis, namely M. marburgensis DX01. The isolation and characterization of the new M. marburgensis DX01 strain expands the known range of the Methanothermobacter genus.},

The cells were irregular, nonmotile, and coccoid (diameter, 0.4 to 2.0) and grew by producing methane from H2-CO2 or formate but not from methanol, methylamines, or acetate. They exhibited a negative Gram reaction, had protein cell walls, and were susceptible to lysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate. They grew over a narrow pH range (pH 6.5 to 7.5), with fastest growth near pH 7, and they were mesophilic (growth was most rapid at 37°). Cells grew fastest with 15 g or less of NaCl per liter of medium.

abstract = {Methanosarcina is the only acetate-consuming genus of methanogenic archaea other than Methanosaeta and thus is important in methanogenic environments for the formation of the greenhouse gases methane and carbon dioxide. However, little is known about isotopic discrimination during acetoclastic CH(4) production. Therefore, we studied two species of the Methanosarcinaceae family, Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanosarcina acetivorans, and a methanogenic rice field soil amended with acetate. The values of the isotope enrichment factor (epsilon) associated with consumption of total acetate (epsilon(ac)), consumption of acetate-methyl (epsilon(ac-methyl)) and production of CH(4) (epsilon(CH4)) were an epsilon(ac) of -30.5 per thousand, an epsilon(ac-methyl) of -25.6 per thousand, and an epsilon(CH4) of -27.4 per thousand for M. barkeri and an epsilon(ac) of -35.3 per thousand, an epsilon(ac-methyl) of -24.8 per thousand, and an epsilon(CH4) of -23.8 per thousand for M. acetivorans. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of archaeal 16S rRNA genes indicated that acetoclastic methanogenic populations in rice field soil were dominated by Methanosarcina spp. Isotope fractionation determined during acetoclastic methanogenesis in rice field soil resulted in an epsilon(ac) of -18.7 per thousand, an epsilon(ac-methyl) of -16.9 per thousand, and an epsilon(CH4) of -20.8 per thousand. However, in rice field soil as well as in the pure cultures, values of epsilon(ac) and epsilon(ac-methyl) decreased as acetate concentrations decreased, eventually approaching zero. Thus, isotope fractionation of acetate carbon was apparently affected by substrate concentration. The epsilon values determined in pure cultures were consistent with those in rice field soil if the concentration of acetate was taken into account.},

In digestor experiments, addition of oil was found to be inhibitory during start-up and the inhibitory effect was less pronounced when the oil was added in the form of bentonite-bound oil compared to when the oil was added alone. After adaption of the digestors, very rapid degradation of oil was observed and more than 80{\%} of the oil was degraded within a few hours after daily feeding. In batch experiments, glyceride trioleate was found to be inhibitory to thermophilic anaerobic digestion when the concentrations were higher than 2.0 g/l. However, addition of bentonite (a clay mineral) at concentrations of 0.15{\%} and 0.45{\%} was found to partly overcome this inhibition. Addition of calcium chloride in concentration of 3 mM (0.033{\%} w/v) showed a similar positive effect on the utilization of oil, but the effect was lower than with bentonite.},

They also possessed high sequence similarity, 97.4{\%}, to Methanoculleus palmolei strain INSLUZ(T) (97.4{\%} and 97.5{\%}, respectively), indicating that they represented a novel species within the genus Methanoculleus.

The three strains used H2/CO2 or sodium formate as substrates for methanogenesis but not sodium acetate, trimethylamine, monomethylamine, ethanol, dimethyl sulfide, isopropanol, isobutanol, butan-2-ol or H2/CO. Optimum growth of strain ZC-2T occurred in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl, pH 7.5-7.8 and temperature 50-55 degrees C with a specific growth rate of 0.084 h(-1). The mol{\%} G+C content of the genomic DNA was 55.2 mol{\%}. Based on these phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, strains ZC-2T, ZC-3 and ZC-6 are proposed to represent a novel species in the genus Methanoculleus and named Methanoculleus receptaculi sp. nov.

Strain PK could ferment complex organic nitrogen sources (e.g. yeast extract, peptone, tryptone) and was able to reduce elemental sulfur (S), Fe(3+) and Mn(4+) . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the organism belonged to the order Thermococcales. Incubations of this strain with elemental iron (Fe) resulted in the abiotic formation of ferrous iron and the accumulation of volatile fatty acids during yeast extract fermentation. The other isolate, strain MG, was a H(2) :CO(2) -utilizing methanogen, phylogenetically affiliated with the genus Methanothermobacter family. Co-cultures of the strains grew as aggregates that produced CH(4) without exogenous H(2) amendment. The co-culture produced the same suite but greater concentrations of fatty acids from yeast extract than did strain PK alone. Thus, the physiological characteristics of organisms both alone and in combination could conceivably contribute to pipeline corrosion. The Thermococcus strain PK could reduce elemental sulfur to sulfide, produce fatty acids and reduce ferric iron. The hydrogenotrophic methanogen strain MG enhanced fatty acid production by fermentative organisms but could not couple the dissolution Fe with the consumption of water-derived H(2) like other methanogens.},

The results show that the specific methanogenic activity of anaerobic granular sludge suffers inhibition from ammonia nitrogen, the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen that produce 50{\%} inhibition of specific methanogenic activity for sludge from UASB and EGSB reactor are 2.35 and 2.75 g/L, respectively. Hydrogen utilizing methanogens suffers less inhibition from ammonia nitrogen than that of acetate utilizing methanogens. Hydrogen-producing acetogens that utilize propionate and butyrate as substrates suffer serious inhibition from ammonia nitrogen. The toxicity of ammonia nitrogen to anaerobic granular sludge enhances when pH value and temperature increase. Anaerobic granular sludge can bear higher concentrations of ammonia nitrogen after being acclimated by ammonia nitrogen for 7 d.},

In this study, methanogenic archaea diverity of a biogas reactor supplied with swine feces as mono-substrate under mesophilic conditions was investigated. Community composition was determined by analysis of methyl coenzyme reductase subunit A gene (mcrA) clone library consisting of 123 clones. Statistical analysis of mcrA library indicated that all major groups of methanogens from our biogas reactor were detected. In the library, 57.7{\%} clones were affiliated to Methanobacteriales, 34.2{\%} to Methanomicrobiales, 2.4{\%} to Methanosarcinales and about 5.7{\%} clones belonged to unclassified euryarchaeota. Over 90{\%} of the methanogenic archaea from our biogas reactor were postulated to be hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Comparing with other previous studies reporting that hydrogenotrophic methanogens are dominant species in the biogas plants, this study firstly reported that Methanobacteriales instead of Methanomicrobiales are the most predominant methanogenic archaea in the biogas reactor fed with swine feces as sole substrate.},

abstract = {Four anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBRs) were operated during a period of 988 days to evaluate the effect of temperature, ammonia, and their interconnectivity on the methane yield of anaerobic processes for animal waste treatment. During period 1 (day 0-378), the methane yield was 0.31 L CH4/g volatile solids (VS) for all digesters (with no statistical differences among them) at a temperature and total ammonium-N levels of 25 °C and {\~{}}1200 mg NH4+-N/L, respectively. During period 2 (day 379-745), the methane yield at 25 °C decreased by 45{\%} when total ammonium-N and ammonia-N were increased in two of the four ASBRs to levels {\textgreater}4000 mg NH4+-N/L and {\textgreater}80 mg NH3-N/L, respectively. During period 3 (day 746-988), this relative inhibition was reduced from 45{\%} to 13{\%} compared to the low-ammonia control reactors when the operating temperature was increased from 25 °C to 35 °C (while the free ammonia levels increased from {\~{}}100 to {\~{}}250 mg NH3-N/L). The 10 °C increase in temperature doubled the rate constant for methanogenesis, which overwhelmed the elevated toxicity effects caused by the increasing concentration of free ammonia. Thus, the farmer/operator may alleviate ammonia toxicity by increasing the operating temperature within the mesophilic range. We extrapolated our data to correlate temperature, ammonia, and methane yield and to hypothesize that the difference between high- and low-ammonia reactors is negligible at the optimum mesophilic temperature of 38 °C.},

Growth is fastest in the presence of 0.4 to 0.6 M Na+, in the presence of 60 to 200 mM Mg2+, at pH 6.5 to 6.8, and at 40{\{}degrees{\}}C. Growth on trimethylamine is stimulated by yeast extract. An electrophoretic analysis confirmed that strain HI350 is closely related to strain T4/MT and indicated that major changes in the intracellular proteins of M. siciliae HI350 occur when the growth substrate is switched between dimethyl sulfide and trimethylamine.},

abstract = {A new acetotrophic marine methane-producing bacterium that was isolated from the methane-evolving sediments of a marine canyon is described. Exponential phase cultures grown with sodium acetate contained irregularly shaped cocci that aggregated in the early stationary phase and finally differentiated into communal cysts that released individual cocci when ruptured or transferred to fresh medium. The irregularly shaped cocci (1.9 +/- 0.2 mm in diameter) were gram negative and occurred singly or in pairs. Cells were nonmotile, but possessed a single fimbria-like structure. Micrographs of thin sections showed a monolayered cell wall approximately 10 nm thick that consisted of protein subunits. The cells in aggregates were separated by visible septation. The communal cysts contained several single cocci encased in a common envelope. An amorphous form of the communal cyst that had incomplete septation and internal membrane-like vesicles was also present in late exponential phase cultures. Sodium acetate, methanol, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine were substrates for growth and methanogenesis; H(2)-CO(2) (80:20) and sodium formate were not. The optimal growth temperature was 35 to 40 degrees C. The optimal pH range was 6.5 to 7.0. Both NaCl and Mg were required for growth, with maximum growth rates at 0.2 M NaCl and 0.05 M MgSO(4). The DNA base composition was 41 +/- 1{\%} guanine plus cytosine. Methanosarcina acetivorans is the proposed species. C2A is the type strain (DSM 2834, ATCC 35395).},

abstract = {The deposition of mine tailings generated from 125 years of sulfidic ore mining resulted in the enrichment of Coeur d'Alene River (CdAR) sediments with significant amounts of toxic heavy metals. A review of literature suggests that microbial populations play a pivotal role in the biogeochemical cycling of elements in such mining-impacted sedimentary environments. To assess the indigenous microbial communities associated with metal-enriched sediments of the CdAR, high-density 16S microarray (PhyloChip) and clone libraries specific to bacteria (16S rRNA), ammonia oxidizers (amoA), and methanogens (mcrA) were analyzed. PhyloChip analysis provided a comprehensive assessment of bacterial populations and detected the largest number of phylotypes in Proteobacteria followed by Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Furthermore, PhyloChip and clone libraries displayed considerable metabolic diversity in indigenous microbial populations by capturing several chemolithotrophic groups such as ammonia oxidizers, iron-reducers and -oxidizers, methanogens, and sulfate-reducers in the CdAR sediments. Twenty-two phylotypes detected on PhyloChip could not be classified even at phylum level thus suggesting the presence of novel microbial populations in the CdAR sediments. Clone libraries demonstrated very limited diversity of ammonia oxidizers and methanogens in the CdAR sediments as evidenced by the fact that only Nitrosospira- and Methanosarcina-related phylotypes were retrieved in amoA and mcrA clone libraries, respectively.},

abstract = {Inhibition of the fermentation of propionate to methane and carbon dioxide by hydrogen, acetate, and propionate was analyzed with a mesophilic propionate-acclimatized sludge that consisted of numerous flocs (size, 150 to 300 {\{}micro{\}}m). The acclimatized sludge could convert propionate to methane and carbon dioxide stoichiometrically without accumulating hydrogen and acetate in a propionate-minimal medium. Inhibition of propionate utilization by propionate could be analyzed by a second-order substrate inhibition model (shown below) given that the substrate saturation constant, Ks, was 15.9 {\{}micro{\}}M; the substrate inhibition constant, Ki, was 0.79 mM; and the maximum specific rate of propionate utilization, qm, was 2.15 mmol/g of mixed-liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) per day: qs = qmS/[Ks + S + (S2/Ki)], where qs is the specific rate of propionate utilization and S is the initial concentration of undissociated propionic acid. For inhibition by hydrogen and acetate to propionate utilization, a noncompetitive product inhibition model was used: qs = qm/[1 + (P/Kp)n], where P is the initial concentration of hydrogen or undissociated acetic acid and Kp is the inhibition constant. Kinetic analysis gave, for hydrogen inhibition, Kp(H2) = 0.11 atm (= 11.1 kPa, 71.5 {\{}micro{\}}M), qm = 2.40 mmol/g of MLVSS per day, and n = 1.51 and, for acetate inhibition, Kp(HAc) = 48.6 {\{}micro{\}}M, qm = 1.85 mmol/g of MLVSS per day, and n = 0.96. It could be concluded that the increase in undissociated propionic acid concentration was a key factor in inhibition of propionate utilization and that hydrogen and acetate cooperatively inhibited propionate degradation, suggesting that hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens might play an important role in enhancing propionate degradation to methane and carbon dioxide.},

A catalytic mechanism for the enzyme from Methanosarcina thermophila has been proposed on the basis of the crystal structure and kinetic analyses of amino acid replacement variants. The Gln43Trp variant was generated to further investigate the catalytic mechanism via changes in fluorescence. The dissociation constants for ADP.Mg2+ and ATP.Mg2+ ligands were determined for the Gln43Trp variant and double variants generated by replacing Arg241 and Arg91 with Ala and Lys. The dissociation constants and kinetic analyses indicated roles for the arginines in transition state stabilization for catalysis but not in nucleotide binding. The results also provide the first experimental evidence for domain motion and evidence that catalysis does not occur as two independent active sites of the homodimer but the active site activities are coordinated in a half-the-sites manner.},

abstract = {Contamination of groundwater by chlorinated solvents such as carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and chloroform (CHCl3) is a widespread problem. The cell exudates from the methanogen Methanosarcina thermophila are active in the degradation of CCl4 and CHCl3. This research was performed to characterize these exudates. Examination of the influence of pH indicated that activity was greater under alkaline conditions. Rapid CCl4 degradation occurred from 35-65 degrees C, with first-order degradation rate coefficients increasing as temperature increased. It was found that proteins were not responsible for CCl4 degradation. The active agents in the cell exudates were {\textless}10 kDa in size, with degradation activity present in both 1-10 kDa and {\textless}1 kDa size ranges. Upon purification of the {\textless}10 kDa size range of the cell exudates on a C(18) chromatography column, 17 fractions (out of 100) degraded {\textgreater}50{\%} of the added CCl4 in 8 h. These 17 fractions were pooled into three samples based on their elution time from the C(18) column. One of these pooled samples contained elevated levels of cobalt, zinc, and iron, at 2, 3, and 13 times the levels measured in similarly fractionated and pooled samples of medium, respectively. The UV-visible spectrum of this pooled sample had an absorption maximum at 560-580 nm, which is similar to the absorption maxima of heme (approximately 550 and 575 nm). The two other pooled samples contained elevated levels of zinc at 11 and 22 times the concentration measured in similarly fractionated and pooled samples of medium, respectively, and also contained very low levels of nickel, cobalt, and iron. This research suggests that the cell exudates from M. thermophila contain porphorinogen-type molecules capable of dechlorination, possibly excreted corrinoids, hemes, and zinc-containing molecules.},

abstract = {Two trials were established to investigate the effect of recycled effluent on hydrolysis during anaerobic co-digestion of vegetable and flower waste. Trial I evaluated the effect by regulating the flow rate of recycled effluent, while Trial II regulated the ratio of hydrolytic effluent to methanogenic effluent, which were recycled to hydrolysis reactor. Results showed that the recirculation of methanogenic effluent could enhance the buffer capability and operation stability of hydrolysis reactor. Higher recycled flow rate was favourable for microbial anabolism and further promoted hydrolysis. After 9 days of hydrolysis, the cumulative SCOD in the hydrolytic effluent reached 334, 407, 413, 581 mg/g at recycled flow rates of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0m{\^{A}}{\l}/(m{\^{A}}{\l}{\^{A}}{\textperiodcentered}d), respectively. It was feasible to recycling a mixture of hydrolytic and methanogenic effluent to the hydrolysis reactor. This research showed that partially introducing hydrolytic effluent into the recycled liquid could enhance hydrolysis, while excessive recirculation of hydrolytic effluent will inhibit the hydrolysis. The flow ratio 1:3 of hydrolytic to methanogenic effluent was found to provide the highest hydrolysis efficiency and degradation rate of lignocelluloses-type biomass, among four ratios of 0:1, 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1. Under this regime, after 9 days of hydrolysis, the cumulative TOC and TN in the hydrolytic effluent reached 162 mg/g and 15 mg/g, the removal efficiency of TS, VS, C and cellulose in the solid phase were 60.66{\%}, 62.88{\%}, 58.35{\%} and 49.12{\%}, respectively. The flow ratio affected fermentation pathways, i.e. lower ratio favoured propionic acid fermentation and the generation of lactic acid while higher ratio promoted butyric acid fermentation.

abstract = {The requirement of Ni2+ and Co2+ addition on methanogenic activity and the coenzymes involved in methanogenesis were investigated in anaerobic continuous cultivation with synthetic wastewater using acetate as the sole carbon source. Addition of Ni2+ and Co2+ to the synthetic wastewater drastically increased the maximum dilution rate of the cultivation. The concentrations of coenzymes F430 and corrinoids in the biomass increased to 0.62 [mu]mol-Ni/g-VSS and 0.67 [mu]mol-Co/g-VSS, respectively with the increase of the dilution rate. Methanogenic activity of the culture broth also increased with an increase of dilution rate. However, without addition of Ni2+ and Co2+, F430 and corrinoids were not detected in the biomass and methanogenic activity was only a trace level at a dilution rate of 0.025 d-1. When the amounts of Ni2+ and Co2+ added at a dilution rate of 0.6 d-1 were lowered in steps, the concentrations of F430 and corrinoids in the biomass and methanogenic activity decreased with decreasing amounts of Ni2+ and Co2+ added. These results suggest that Ni2+ and Co2+ were required for the methane-producing reactions via increases of coenzymes F430 and corrinoids.},

A ratio of 0.067 g Fe(II) per gram H2O2, and 60 g H2O2/kg dried solids (DS) was applied to biological sludge samples preceding anaerobic sludge digestion. Single stage anaerobic digestion under thermophilic conditions is compared with two-stage anaerobic digestion (mesophilic digestion prior to thermophilic digestion). The comparison is in terms of solid reductions and specific methane productions. Fenton processed sludge gives higher solid reduction and higher methane production for each experiment. The highest reduction in sludge's solids was observed in a reactor operated under thermophilic conditions. The second stage digestion under mesophilic conditions did not induce extra solid reduction. However, it facilitated higher methane. Another observation is that, Fenton process led to decrease the biosolids' resistance to dewatering in terms of capillary suction time (CST), but had no effect on sludge dewatering on belt-press application.},

At a hydraulic retention time of 10 days, equivalent to a space loading of 3.3 kg (m3 day)(-1), 90{\%} of the chemical oxygen demand was converted to biogas. Only a little propionate remained in the effluent. Toxicity tests with either copper chloride, zinc chloride or nickel chloride were performed on effluent from the reactor. Fifty per cent inhibition of methanogenesis was observed in the presence of {\textgreater} or =10 mg CuCl2 l(-1) {\textgreater} or =40 mg ZnCl2 l(-1) and {\textgreater} or =60 mg NiCl2 l(-1), respectively. After exposure to Cu2+, Zn2+ or Ni2+ ions for 12 days, complete recovery of methanogenesis by equimolar sulfide addition was possible upon prolonged incubation. Recovery failed, however, for copper chloride concentrations {\textgreater} or =40 mg l(-1). If the sulfide was added simultaneously with the three heavy metal salts, methanogenesis was only slightly retarded and the same amount of methane as in non-inhibited controls was reached either 1 day (40 mg ZnCl2 l(-1) or 2 days later (10 mg CuCl2 l(-1)). Up to 60 mg NiCl2 l(-1) had no effect if sulfide was present. Sulfide presumably precipitated the heavy metals as metal sulfides and by this means prevented heavy metal toxicity.},

This technique enables the determination of the sludge potential for the physical removal of solids, weighing the effect of different process parameters on solids removal and identifying the mechanisms of solids removal in an upflow anaerobic sludge bed system. In this paper guidelines for conducting the test are given and a "standardised" set-up is presented. The experimental set-up and protocol are simple and the results can be obtained in a period as short as a few hours. A sludge sample is added to an upflow reactor incubated at 4 °C, to limit gas production, washed with an anaerobically pre-treated and suspended solids free wastewater to remove solids washed out from the sludge, and then fed with a model substrate, prepared from fish meal with a standard procedure. Several experimental runs were conducted to validate and optimise the technique. The results showed that the technique is reliable, workable and reproducible.},

abstract = {This study analyzed dairy wastewater fermentation in convection- and microwave-heated hybrid reactors at loadings of 1 and 2kgCOD/(m(3)d) and temperatures of 35 and 55°C. The biomass was investigated at a molecular level to determine the links between the operational parameters of anaerobic digestion and methanogenic Archaea structure. The highest production of biogas with methane content of ca. 67{\%} was noted in the mesophilic microwave-heated reactors. The production of methane-rich biogas and the overall diversity of Archaea was determined by Methanosarcinaceae presence. The temperature and the application of microwaves were the main factors explaining the variations in the methanogen community. At 35°C, the microwave heating stimulated the growth of highly diverse methanogen assemblages, promoting Methanosarcina barkeri presence and excluding Methanosarcina harudinacea from the biomass. A temperature increase to 55°C lowered Methanosarcinaceae abundance and induced a replacement of Methanoculleus palmolei by Methanosarcina thermophila.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates methane fermentation that was carried out along with ammonia striping to avoid ammonia accumulation that significantly inhibited methane production. Ammonia was successfully removed by means of recycling of biogas followed by gas washing in sulfuric acid to capture ammonia, when chicken manure was anaerobically digested for 4 days at 55 °C and at an initial pH of 8-9. By using this method, 80{\%} of total nitrogen in chicken manure was converted to ammonia and 82{\%} of the produced ammonia was removed. A bench scale reactor equipped with an ammonia-stripping unit for methane production from chicken manure was developed and operated in repeated batch mode. At an initial pH of 8 and at 55 °C, 195 and 157 ml g-VS-1 of methane was successfully produced from the treated chicken manure and the mixture of treated chicken manure and raw chicken manure in the ratio of 1:1, respectively. In this method, ammonia concentration was maintained at a level lower than 2 g-N kg-wet sludge-1 in the reactor.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to design a microarray targeting methanogens found in anaerobic digesters, and to apply this chip together with a cloning approach to investigate the methanogenic community present in an anaerobic digester. Oligonucleotide probes were designed based on sequence differences in the 16S rRNA genes in order to target microorganisms in situ. For microarray hybridisations, DNA was subjected to PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene and Cy5-labeled. The microarray was tested with pure cultures, and of the 1854 individual probe-target hybridisation reactions performed, there were only 28 false positive (1.5{\%}) and 16 false negative signals (0.86{\%}). The sensitivity of the array was also tested, and it was found that when 0.4pg of DNA from a pure culture was subjected to PCR amplification, signals above the detection limit were obtained. Also, the application of 25ng of PCR product from a pure culture to an array resulted in detectable signals. The ANAEROCHIP was hybridised with DNA from an anaerobic sludge. Strong hybridisation signals were obtained for Methanoculleus, and weaker signals, in decreasing order, were obtained for Methanosarcina, Methanobacterium, Methanobrevibacter, and Methanosphaera. In order to check the results obtained with the microarray, the archaeal community structure of the same digester was analysed by 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing. Community structure was determined by restriction digestion of almost 200 clones and by sequencing of the 15 different resulting patterns. Methanoculleus was the dominant (84.1{\%}) microorganism in the anaerobic sludge, and Methanobrevibacter (5.8{\%}), Methanobacterium (3.7{\%}), Methanosarcina (2.1{\%}), Methanosphaera (1.6{\%}), an uncultured archaeon (1.6{\%}) and Methanothermobacter (1{\%}) were also detected. These results showed the microarray to be a suitable tool for studying methanogenic communities in sludge.},

abstract = {Two trials were established to investigate the effect of recycled effluent on hydrolysis during anaerobic co-digestion of vegetable and flower waste. Trial I evaluated the effect by regulating the flow rate of recycled effluent, while Trial II regulated the ratio of hydrolytic effluent to methanogenic effluent, which were recycled to hydrolysis reactor. Results showed that the recirculation of methanogenic effluent could enhance the buffer capability and operation stability of hydrolysis reactor. Higher recycled flow rate was favourable for microbial anabolism and further promoted hydrolysis. After 9 days of hydrolysis, the cumulative SCOD in the hydrolytic effluent reached 334, 407, 413, 581 mg/g at recycled flow rates of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0m{\^{A}}{\l}/(m{\^{A}}{\l}{\^{A}}{\textperiodcentered}d), respectively. It was feasible to recycling a mixture of hydrolytic and methanogenic effluent to the hydrolysis reactor. This research showed that partially introducing hydrolytic effluent into the recycled liquid could enhance hydrolysis, while excessive recirculation of hydrolytic effluent will inhibit the hydrolysis. The flow ratio 1:3 of hydrolytic to methanogenic effluent was found to provide the highest hydrolysis efficiency and degradation rate of lignocelluloses-type biomass, among four ratios of 0:1, 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1. Under this regime, after 9 days of hydrolysis, the cumulative TOC and TN in the hydrolytic effluent reached 162 mg/g and 15 mg/g, the removal efficiency of TS, VS, C and cellulose in the solid phase were 60.66{\%}, 62.88{\%}, 58.35{\%} and 49.12{\%}, respectively. The flow ratio affected fermentation pathways, i.e. lower ratio favoured propionic acid fermentation and the generation of lactic acid while higher ratio promoted butyric acid fermentation.

Primers designed for use in TaqMan real-time PCR for the organisms Methanosaeta, Methanosarcina, and Methanoculleus have been described previously; however, we found that (i) the Methanoculleus primers were not specific to members of the genus and that (ii) the Methanosarcina primers did not work specifically with SYBR Green real-time PCR. Thus, we designed new primers for these and other methanogens, and we optimized SYBR Green real-time PCR assays. Primers were tested by end-point and real-time PCR, and they were found to work specifically and sensitively.

abstract = {Just as in the Eukarya and the Bacteria, members of the Archaea need to export proteins beyond the cell membrane. This would be required to fulfill a variety of essential functions such as nutrient acquisition and biotransformations, maintenance of extracellular structures and more. Apart from the Eukarya and the Bacteria however, members of the Archaea share a number of unique characteristics. Does this uniqueness extend to the protein secretion system? It was the objective of this study to answer this question. To overcome the limited experimental information on secreted proteins in Archaea, this study was carried out by subjecting the available archaeal genomes, which represent halophiles, thermophiles, and extreme thermophiles, to bioinformatics analysis. Specifically, to examine the properties of the secretomes of the Archaea using the ExProt program. A total of 24 genomes were analyzed. Secretomes were found to fall in the range of 6{\%} of total ORFs (Methanopyrus kandleri) to 19{\%} (Halobacterium sp. NRC-1). Methanosarcina acetivorans has the highest fraction of lipoproteins (at 89) and the lowest (at 1) were members of the Thermoplasma, Pyrobaculum aerophilum, and Nanoarchaeum equitans. Based on the Tat consensus sequence, contribution of these secreted proteins to the secretomes were negligible, making up 8 proteins out of a total of 7105 predicted exported proteins. Amino acid composition, an attribute of signal peptides not used as a selection criteria by ExProt, of predicted archaeal signal peptides show that in the haloarchaea secretomes, the frequency of the amino acid Lys is much lower than that seen in bacterial signal peptides, but is compensated for by a higher frequency of Arg. It also showed that higher frequencies for Thr, Val, and Gly contribute to the hydrophobic character in haloarchaeal signal peptides, unlike bacterial signal peptides in which the hydrophobic character is dominated by Leu and Ile.},

A ratio of 0.067 g Fe(II) per gram H2O2, and 60 g H2O2/kg dried solids (DS) was applied to biological sludge samples preceding anaerobic sludge digestion. Single stage anaerobic digestion under thermophilic conditions is compared with two-stage anaerobic digestion (mesophilic digestion prior to thermophilic digestion). The comparison is in terms of solid reductions and specific methane productions. Fenton processed sludge gives higher solid reduction and higher methane production for each experiment. The highest reduction in sludge's solids was observed in a reactor operated under thermophilic conditions. The second stage digestion under mesophilic conditions did not induce extra solid reduction. However, it facilitated higher methane. Another observation is that, Fenton process led to decrease the biosolids' resistance to dewatering in terms of capillary suction time (CST), but had no effect on sludge dewatering on belt-press application.},

The bioreactor used was batch fed and contained sepiolite as support for the mediating bacteria. Experimental data observed for methane production (G) against time (t) are described by the following equation: G = GM[1 - exp( - Axt/S0), over the COD range studied (3.9-14.5 g/l), where: GM is the maximum methane volume obtained at the end of digestion time; S0 is the initial substrate concentration; X is the microorganism concentration and A is the kinetic constant of the process, which was calculated using a nonlinear regression. This kinetic parameter was found to be influenced by the pretreatment carried out, and was 4.6, 4.1 and 2.3 times higher for Aspergillus, Azotobacter and Geotrichum-pretreated OMW's than that obtained in the anaerobic digestion of untreated OMW. The kinetic constant increased when the phenolic compound content and biotoxicity of the pretreated-OMW's decreased. Finally, the yield coefficient, Tp, was 260 (untreated OMW), 300 (Geotrichum-pretreated OMW), 315 (Azotobacter-pretreated OMW) and 350 (Aspergillus-pretreated OMW) ml CH4 STP/g COD.},

The digester performance was evaluated with two calibration tests, the main for a period of 56 days. The study test was divided into three phases, one for each type of feeding operation (batch, fed-batch, batch). The initial phase of digestion resulted in 57 l-CH(4)/kg-VS, the second phase had a yield of 86.6 l-CH(4)/kg-VS and the third one had a production of 67 l-CH(4)/kg-VS. The total methane yield was equal to 211.4 l-CH(4)/kg-VS. Using the obtained pilot plant results to a real scale diary production cycle, it was possible to evaluate an electricity production equal to 8.86 kwh per 1 t/d. The conducted tests did show that there is a good potential to the use of a cow manure and whey biomass mix for biogas production.},

abstract = {Batch assays were performed with samples from a silage-fed mesophilic biogas process accumulating acetate to examine if the addition of single trace elements (iron, nickel, cobalt and molybdenum) or a mixture of trace elements could improve the process. The results from the batch assays led to the addition of cobalt to reach a concentration of 0.2 mg L-1. This made it possible to increase the organic loading rate (OLR) above that in a parallel process not receiving any extra cobalt. Problems with low gas production and decreasing pH were overcome by the daily supply of this single element in small amounts. Acetate conversion to methane was improved, which was confirmed by increased specific methanogenic activity (SMA) with acetate as a substrate. As a consequence, an OLR of 7.0 g VS L-1 day-1 was achieved at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days with an equivalent increase in methane production. Without cobalt addition, an OLR of 5.0 g VS L-1 day-1 with an HRT of 20 days was reached after 70 weeks operation.},

High COD removal efficiencies were obtained in both control and supplemented UASB reactors (around 85{\%}). By adding 2 ml glycerol product per liter of raw wastewater, the biogas production could be increased by 0.74 l biogas ml−1 glycerol product, which leads to energy values in the range of 810–1270 kWhelectric per m3 product. Moreover, a better in-reactor biomass yield was observed for the supplemented UASB reactor (0.012 g VSS g−1 CODremoved) compared to the UASB control (0.002 g VSS g−1 CODremoved), which suggests a positive effect of glycerol on the sludge blanket growth.},

abstract = {Batch assays were performed with samples from a silage-fed mesophilic biogas process accumulating acetate to examine if the addition of single trace elements (iron, nickel, cobalt and molybdenum) or a mixture of trace elements could improve the process. The results from the batch assays led to the addition of cobalt to reach a concentration of 0.2 mg L-1. This made it possible to increase the organic loading rate (OLR) above that in a parallel process not receiving any extra cobalt. Problems with low gas production and decreasing pH were overcome by the daily supply of this single element in small amounts. Acetate conversion to methane was improved, which was confirmed by increased specific methanogenic activity (SMA) with acetate as a substrate. As a consequence, an OLR of 7.0 g VS L-1 day-1 was achieved at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 days with an equivalent increase in methane production. Without cobalt addition, an OLR of 5.0 g VS L-1 day-1 with an HRT of 20 days was reached after 70 weeks operation.},

When the sulphide concentration was too low for optimal growth (e.g., 0.1 mM Na2S added) the addition of the redox resin ‘Serdoxit' acted as a sulphide reservoir and caused a significant stimulation of growth. Furthermore it could be demonstrated that iron sulphide, zinc sulphide or L-methionine could also act as sulphur sources while the addition of sodium sulphate to sulphide-depleted media failed to restore growth. The amino acid L-cysteine (0.85 mM) stimulated growth but could not replace Na2S.},

The reactor containing granulated biomass treating synthetic domestic wastewater was operated at 30 °C and an 8-h cycle was applied to treat approximately 2.0 l of the synthetic substrate with COD of nearly 500 mg/l. The studied agitation rates ranged from no agitation to 75 rev./min. The system attained non-filtered and filtered substrate removal efficiency of 80 and 88{\%}, respectively, at the agitation rate of 50 rev./min, presenting a relatively good solid retention and no granule break-up. Moreover, the use of agitation mainly increased the efficiency throughout the cycle of the reactor and, consequently, enabled reduction of the total cycle time. An empirical equation and a first order kinetic model with a residual organic matter concentration were proposed to analyze the influence of agitation rates on the reactor's performance.},

The biomass was investigated at a molecular level to determine the links between the operational parameters of anaerobic digestion and methanogenic Archaea structure. The highest production of biogas with methane content of ca. 67{\%} was noted in the mesophilic microwave-heated reactors. The production of methane-rich biogas and the overall diversity of Archaea was determined by Methanosarcinaceae presence. The temperature and the application of microwaves were the main factors explaining the variations in the methanogen community. At 35°C, the microwave heating stimulated the growth of highly diverse methanogen assemblages, promoting Methanosarcina barkeri presence and excluding Methanosarcina harudinacea from the biomass. A temperature increase to 55°C lowered Methanosarcinaceae abundance and induced a replacement of Methanoculleus palmolei by Methanosarcina thermophila.},

The bioreactor used was batch fed and contained sepiolite as support for the mediating bacteria. Experimental data observed for methane production (G) against time (t) are described by the following equation: G = GM[1 - exp( - Axt/S0), over the COD range studied (3.9-14.5 g/l), where: GM is the maximum methane volume obtained at the end of digestion time; S0 is the initial substrate concentration; X is the microorganism concentration and A is the kinetic constant of the process, which was calculated using a nonlinear regression. This kinetic parameter was found to be influenced by the pretreatment carried out, and was 4.6, 4.1 and 2.3 times higher for Aspergillus, Azotobacter and Geotrichum-pretreated OMW's than that obtained in the anaerobic digestion of untreated OMW. The kinetic constant increased when the phenolic compound content and biotoxicity of the pretreated-OMW's decreased. Finally, the yield coefficient, Tp, was 260 (untreated OMW), 300 (Geotrichum-pretreated OMW), 315 (Azotobacter-pretreated OMW) and 350 (Aspergillus-pretreated OMW) ml CH4 STP/g COD.},

These new oligonucleotide probes facilitated the identification, localization, and quantification of the specific relative abundance of M. concilii and Methanosarcina barkeri, which play important roles in methanogenesis. The combined use of fluorescent in situ hybridization with confocal scanning laser microscopy demonstrated that anaerobic granule topography depends on granule origin and feeding. Protein-fed granules showed no layered structure with a random distribution of M. concilii. In contrast, a layered structure developed in methanol-enriched granules, where M. barkeri growth was induced in an outer layer. This outer layer was followed by a layer composed of M. concilii, with an inner core of M. concilii and other bacteria.},

abstract = {The influence of environmental conditions on the biological transformation of a contaminant must be well understood to optimize remediation processes. One factor that impacts the biological transformation of carbon tetrachloride (CT) is elemental iron (Fe0). Previous research has shown that Fe0 increases the methanogenic CT degradation rate by providing H2 for cell growth and dechlorination. As Fe0 oxidizes it also increases the pH and Fe2+ levels, which may also impact the biological transformation of CT. Experiments were performed with Methanosarcina thermophila to investigate the influence of these factors on CT degradation. The transformation of CT and CF was greatly influenced by pH, with the rate of CT and CF degradation increasing with increasing pH. After 6 h, {\textgreater} 90{\%} of the CT had been degraded in the treatments containing cells at a pH of 8.5, whereas only about 51{\%} of the CT had been degraded in similar treatments at a pH of 5.5. Fe2+ did not significantly influence the degradation of CT; however, 60{\%} less CF was formed in systems containing cells+Fe2+ than in systems containing cells only. In addition. Fe2+ promoted rapid transformation of CF when added to treatments containing cells. The product distribution after 9 days in all systems containing cells was very similar, with 98.04 +/- 5.46{\%} (two-sided 95{\%} confidence interval) of the originally fed CT present as soluble products. These results show that pH and Fe2+ influence the degradation of CT and CF, although transiently. Because the residence time of contaminants in Fe0 barriers varies with the thickness of the barrier, it is likely that this influence will be important for some flow-through systems. This implies that a combined Fe0/organism remediation system may have previously unrealized advantages (due to pH and Fe2+ changes).},

Peptone was easily hydrolysed to amino acids under methanogenic conditions, and all amino acids were completely degraded to volatile fatty acids, carbon dioxide and ammonium. Under these conditions, amino acids known to be oxidatively deaminated were degraded more slowly than the other amino acids. Inhibition of methanogenesis by 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid led to the accumulation of hydrogen in the gas phase and to the immediate inhibition of both protein hydrolysis and the degradation of amino acids that are preferentially oxidatively deaminated. These effects resulted in lower concentrations of all volatile fatty acids except for butyrate and caproate, which increased in concentration. Interspecies hydrogen transfer appeared to be necessary for the complete degradation of alanine, phenylalanine, methionine, valine, leucine and isoleucine. [alpha]-Aminobutyrate also accumulated when methanogenesis was inhibited.},

Moreover, a better in-reactor biomass yield was observed for the supplemented UASB reactor (0.012 g VSS g−1 CODremoved) compared to the UASB control (0.002 g VSS g−1 CODremoved), which suggests a positive effect of glycerol on the sludge blanket growth.},

Growth of Methanosarcina acetivorans on carbon monoxide (CO) is peculiar as it involves formation of, besides methane, formate, acetate and methylated thiols. It has been argued that methane formation is partially inhibited under carboxidotrophic conditions and that the other products result from either detoxification of CO or from bypassing methanogenesis with other pathways for energy conservation. To gain a deeper understanding of the CO-dependent physiology of M. acetivorans we analyzed metabolite formation in resting cells. The initial rates of methane, acetate, formate, and dimethylsulfide formation increased differentially with increasing CO concentrations but were maximal already at the same moderate CO partial pressure. Strikingly, further increase of the amount of CO was not inhibitory. The maximal rate of methane formation from CO was approximately fivefold lower than that from methanol, consistent with the previously observed significant downregulation of the energy converting sodium-dependent methyltransferase. The rate of dimethylsulfide formation from CO was only 1-2{\%} of that of methane formation under any conditions tested. Implications of the data presented for previously proposed pathways of CO utilization are discussed.},

abstract = {ADM1 represents a universally applicable biokinetic model for the mathematical description of anaerobic digestion of different types of organic substrates. Digestion of particulate composites is described as a five-stage process involving disintegration, hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis, of which the last three process steps are represented by growth kinetics of the specific degrading biomass. Decay of the produced biomass according to ADM1 is depicted by a recycle mass flux to the composite particulate substrate. Consequently two different actions are lumped into one process describing both conversion of feed substrate (depending primarily on influent characterisation) and generation of decay products (depending on digestion performance). In this presentation the introduction of a separate compound of inert decay products in analogy to ASM1 is suggested. Model calibration of separately monitored digestion of primary and secondary sludge (nitrogen content 0.030 g N/g TSS and 0.051 g N/g TSS, respectively) reveals the advantage of a clear distinction of disintegration and decay. The fate of nitrogen in the course of incorporation and release (0.016 g N/g TSS compared to 0.028 g N/g TSS) during digestion processes is comprehensible and the final ammonia concentration in the rejection water becomes predictable.},

Transient hydrogen production was observed and quantified for each species studied. Methane was excluded as the electron source, as was all organic material added during growth of the cultures (acetate, yeast extract, peptone). Hydrogen production showed a strong temperature dependence, and production ceased at temperatures below the growth range of the organisms. Addition of polysulfides to the cultures greatly decreased hydrogen production. The addition of bromoethanesulfonic acid had little influence on hydrogen production. These experiments demonstrate that some methanogens produce excess reducing equivalents during growth and convert them to hydrogen when the ambient hydrogen concentration becomes low. The lack of sustained hydrogen production by the cultures in the presence of methane provides evidence against "reverse methanogenesis" as the mechanism for anaerobic methane oxidation.},

abstract = {Three novel DNA-binding proteins with apparent molecular masses of 7, 10 and 30 kDa have been isolated from the hyperthermophilic methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri. The proteins were identified using a blot overlay assay that was modified to emulate the high ionic strength intracellular environment of M.kandleri proteins. A 7 kDa protein, named 7kMk, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. As indicated by CD spectroscopy and computer-assisted structure prediction methods, 7kMk is a substantially alpha-helical protein possibly containing a short N-terminal beta-strand. According to analytical gel filtration chromatography and chemical crosslinking, 7kMk exists as a stable dimer, susceptible to further oligomerization. Electron microscopy showed that 7kMk bends DNA and also leads to the formation of loop-like structures of approximately 43.5 +/- 3.5 nm (136 +/- 11 bp for B-form DNA) circumference. A topoisomerase relaxation assay demonstrated that looped DNA is negatively supercoiled under physiologically relevant conditions (high salt and temperature). A BLAST search did not yield 7kMk homologs at the amino acid sequence level, but based on a multiple alignment with ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) transcriptional regulators, fold features and self-association properties of 7kMk we hypothesize that it could be related to RHH proteins.},

The compositions of acetate, propionate and butyrate used as substrate were 25:35:40. The tests were performed at constant temperature (55°C) and pH 7 on two duplicate batch reactors (I and II) running in parallel and were repeated to show the effect of acclimatization. During the first feeding, there was a significant lag phase and after about 23 h incubation the volumes of CH4 gases produced from two reactors were only about 20 and 490 ml, respectively. In this experiment, propionate was converted to acetate only after the initial concentrations of butyrate and acetate had completely degraded. Acetate formed from propionate was immediately converted to methane and carbon dioxide. The maximum methanogenic activities of the first feeding were not high because the natural populations of the propionate-degrading bacteria were low and the sludge adapted itself to the VFAs' substrate very slowly. In a second experiment with the same sludge, the maximum methanogenic activities of the second feedings were about 1.60 times higher than those of the first feedings because of the adaptation of the sludge and increase of populations of the propionate-degrading bacteria.},

abstract = {The applicability of different kinetics to the hydrolysis of particulate organic material in anaerobic digestion is discussed. Hydrolysis has traditionally been modelled according to the first-order kinetics. For complex substrate, the first-order kinetics should be modified in order to take into account hardly degradable material. It has been shown that models in which hydrolysis is coupled to the growth of hydrolytic bacteria work well at high or at fluctuant organic loading. In particular, the surface-related two-phase and the Contois models showed good fits to experimental data from a wide range of organic waste. Both models tend to the first-order kinetics at a high biomass-to-waste ratio and, for this reason, they can be considered as more general models. Examples on different inhibition processes that might affect the degradation of solid waste are reported. Acetogenesis or methanogenesis might be the rate-limiting stages in complex waste. In such cases, stimulation of hydrolysis (mechanically, chemically or biologically) may lead to a further inhibition of these stages, which ultimately affects hydrolysis as well. Since the hydrolysis process is characterized by surface and transport phenomena, new developments in spatially distributed models are considered fundamental to provide new insights in this complex process.},

abstract = {Glycosylation is a posttranslational modification utilized in all three domains of life. Compared to eukaryotic and bacterial systems, knowledge of the archaeal processes involved in glycosylation is limited. Recently, Methanococcus voltae flagellin proteins were found to have an N-linked trisaccharide necessary for proper flagellum assembly. Current analysis by mass spectrometry of Methanococcus maripaludis flagellin proteins also indicated the attachment of an N-glycan containing acetylated sugars. To identify genes involved in sugar biosynthesis in M. maripaludis, a putative acetyltransferase was targeted for in-frame deletion. Deletion of this gene (MMP0350) resulted in a flagellin molecular mass shift to a size comparable to that expected for underglycosylated or completely nonglycoslyated flagellins, as determined by immunoblotting. Assembled flagellar filaments were not observed by electron microscopy. Interestingly, the deletion also resulted in defective pilus anchoring. Mutant cells with a deletion of MMP0350 had very few, if any, pili attached to the cell surface compared to a nonflagellated but piliated strain. However, pili were obtained from culture supernatants of this strain, indicating that the defect was not in pilus assembly but in stable attachment to the cell surface. Complementation of MMP0350 on a plasmid restored pilus attachment, but it was unable to restore flagellation, likely because the mutant ceased to make detectable flagellin. These findings represent the first report of a biosynthetic gene involved in flagellin glycosylation in archaea. Also, it is the first gene to be associated with pili, linking flagellum and pilus structure and assembly through posttranslational modifications.},

This study shows that the reaction of butyrate degradation to acetate and hydrogen could happen when gas sparging was applied. Gas sparging was very important for reducing hydrogen partial pressure and made the reaction thermodynamically possible. Almost no hydrogen or methane (methane production was prevented by the addition of 2-bromoethane-sulfonic acid) was detected, indicating that the H2 produced from butyrate oxidation was consumed in a subsequent step. It was found by isotope experiments that hydrogen produced from butyrate degradation reacted immediately with CO2 to form acetate via homoacetogenesis. When CO2/HCO3- was not provided in the system, butyrate degradation was no longer possible and butyrate-degrading cultures were washed out. It was furthermore found that the microorganisms responsible for homoacetogenesis were likely present in normal anaerobic environments, such as biogas reactors.},

abstract = {Control of sulfate reduction by adding molybdate was investigated to enhance the methane production under batch and continuous operation in the anaerobic digestion of a sulfate-rich lysine wastewater. In phase 1 of the continuous operation, four anaerobic filters were fed with the lysine wastewater and then added with molybdate at 1,3,5 and 10 mM just after methane producing bacteria (MPB) were completely inhibited by H2S produced by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). In phase 2, three anaerobic filters were operated with continuous or intermittent addition of 3 mM molybdate from the beginning of operation, including one with no molybdate as a control. Batch experiments revealed that the sulfate reduction was strongly inhibited and finally ceased by adding 3 mM or more of molybdate, resulting in great enhancement of the methane production. In phase 1 of the continuous experiments, all reactors showed the cessation of the methane production when the content of H2S reached 9-10 {\%} in biogas, but the MPB activity was gradually recovered after initiating the molybdate addition at 3 or 5 mM. The 10 mM dosage of molybdate, however, had an inhibiting effect to MPB as well as SRB, resulting in the accumulation of acetate within the reactor. In phase 2, the control reactor continued to decrease the methane production, and a methane conversion rate was only 3{\%} in the control, while 35 and 10{\%} in continuously-added and intermittently-added reactors, respectively. Thus, it was confirmed that the MPB activity was greatly enhanced under control of the SRB activity by the continuous addition of molybdate. Comparing phase 2 with phase 1, addition from the start-up of the process is considered more effective than addition after the methane production dropped in the control of the sulfate reduction by molybdate.},

abstract = {The microbial populations responsible for anaerobic degradation of phthalate isomers were investigated by enrichment and isolation of those microbes from anaerobic sludge treating wastewater from the manufacturing of terephthalic acid. Primary enrichments were made with each of three phthalate isomers (ortho-, iso-, and terephthalate) as the sole energy source at 37°C with two sources of anaerobic sludge (both had been used to treat wastewater containing high concentrations of phthalate isomers) as the inoculum. Six methanogenic enrichment cultures were obtained which not only degraded the isomer used for the enrichment but also had the potential to degrade part of other phthalate isomers as well as benzoate with concomitant production of methane, presumably involving strictly syntrophic substrate degradation. Our 16S rRNA gene-cloning analysis combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the predominant bacteria in the enrichment cultures were affiliated with a recently recognized non-sulfate-reducing subcluster (subcluster Ih) in the group ‘Desulfotomaculum lineage I' or a clone cluster (group TA) in the class delta-Proteobacteria. Several attempts were made to isolate these microbes, resulting in the isolation of a terephthalate-degrading bacterium, designated strain JT, in pure culture. A coculture of the strain with the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanospirillum hungatei converted terephthalate to acetate and methane within 3 months of incubation, whereas strain JT could not degrade terephthalate in pure culture. During the degradation of terephthalate, a small amount of benzoate was transiently accumulated as an intermediate, indicative of decarboxylation of terephthalate to benzoate as the initial step of the degradation. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the strain was a member of subcluster Ih of the group ‘Desulfotomaculum lineage I', but it was only distantly related to other known species.},

Most probable number (MPN) cultivations were accomplished with a sample from a 600 m(3) reactor from which all manures used in the experiments originated, and equal cell counts of ca. 10(9) g dry mass(-1) were found for cultivations with acetate, H(2) and methanol. SSCP analysis of these samples and sequencing of the DNA bands identified different hydrogenotrophic methanogens in all samples, and acetoclastic methanogens closely related to Methanosarcina mazei in the samples cultivated with acetate and methanol. As the acetoclastic species were not found in any other SSCP sample, it was supposed that the ammonia values in the manure of the laboratory biogas reactor, which ranged from 2.48 to 3.61 g NH(4)-NL(-1), inhibited the growth of the acetoclastic methanogens.},

abstract = {Microbial formate production and consumption during syntrophic conversion of ethanol or lactate to methane was examined in purified flocs and digestor contents obtained from a whey-processing digestor. Formate production by digestor contents or purified digestor flocs was dependent on CO2 and either ethanol or lactate but not H2 gas as an electron donor. During syntrophic methanogenesis, flocs were the primary site for formate production via ethanol-dependent CO2 reduction, with a formate production rate and methanogenic turnover constant of 660 ,uM/h and 0.044/min, respectively. Floc preparations accumulated fourfoldhigher levels of formate (40 ,uM) than digestor contents, and the free flora was the primary site for formate cleavage to CO2 and H2 (90 ,uM formate per h). Inhibition of methanogenesis by CHCI3 resulted in formate accumulation and suppression of syntrophic ethanol oxidation. H2 gas was an insignificant intermediary metabolite of syntrophic ethanol conversion by flocs, and its exogenous addition neither stimulated methanogenesis nor inhibited the initial rate of ethanol oxidation. These results demonstrated that {\textgreater}90{\%} of the syntrophic ethanol conversion to methane by mixed cultures containing primarily Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Methanobacteriumformicicum was mediated via interspecies formate transfer and that {\textless}10{\%} was mediated via interspecies H2 transfer. The results are discussed in relation to biochemical thermodynamics. A model is presented which describes the dynamics of a bicarbonate-formate electron shuttle mechanism for control of carbon and electron flow during syntrophic methanogenesis and provides a novel mechanism for energy conservation by syntrophic acetogens.},

abstract = {Hydrogen gas stimulated sulphate reduction in a saltmarsh sediment and the importance of H2 transferred from organotrophic bacteria to the sulphate-reducers is discussed. beta-fluorolactate inhibited sulphate reduction whether lactate, ethanol or hydrogen was being used as growth substrate. When added to sediment beta-fluorolactate inhibited sulphate reduction with a consequent increase in methane production. Addition of H2 stimulated methanogenesis in sediment and this stimulation was greater if CO2 was also present. Hydrogen availability was the primary limitation of methanogenesis but the low concentration of dissolved CO2 in seawater may limit methane production even if H2 is available. The removal of inhibition of methanogenesis by the use of fluorolactate to suppress sulphate reduction or by the provision of hydrogen indicates competitive inhibition of methanogens by sulphate reducers utilizing transferred hydrogen.},

In order to couple process stability and high loads, a new downflow-upflow hybrid reactor (DUHR) has been designed. The reactor was able to reach Bv values around 10 g COD{\textperiodcentered}1-1{\textperiodcentered}d-1, with 98{\%} COD converted to gas and effluent soluble COD values close to 1,000 ppm; no external addition of alkalinity is required to maintain a stable pH that was constantly around 6.5-6.7 in the downflow pre-acidification chamber and around 7.5 in the bio-methanation upflow chamber. The high strength of the cheese whey treated gives an effluent that still contains high amounts of COD, ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus and therefore a post treatment is required in order to meet standard limits. Tests of post treatment were carried out during two years with a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR). The SBR was tested at various F/M values with different durations of anoxic-anaerobic-oxic cycles, obtaining, under certain conditions, more than 90{\%} removal of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus.},

A protein designated HMf (histone M. fervidus) has been isolated from this archaeal hyperthermophile that binds to double-stranded DNA molecules and increases their resistance to thermal denaturation. HMf binding to linear double-stranded DNA molecules of greater than 2 kilobase pairs also increases their electrophoretic mobilities through agarose gels. Visualization of this compaction process by electron microscopy has demonstrated the formation of quasispherical, macromolecular HMf-DNA complexes. HMf is a mixture of approximately equal amounts of two very similar polypeptides designated HMf-1 and HMf-2. Determination of the DNA sequence of the gene encoding HMf-2 (hmfB) has revealed that over 30{\%} of the amino acid residues in HMf-2 are conserved in the consensus sequences derived for eucaryal histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. These archaeal polypeptides and eucaryal histones appear therefore to have evolved from a common ancestor and are likely to have related structures and functions.},

abstract = {In the present work, the main objective was to evaluate a biofiltration system for removing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) contained in a gaseous stream from an anaerobic digestor (AD). The elimination of these compounds allowed the potential use of biogas while maintaining the methane (CH4) content throughout the process. The biodegradation of H2S was determined in the lava rock biofilter under two different empty bed residence times (EBRT). Inlet loadings lower than 200 g/m3 h at an EBRT of 81 s yielded a complete removal, attaining an elimination capacity (EC) of 142 g/m3 h, whereas at an EBRT of 31 s, a critical EC of 200 g/m3 h was reached and the EC obtained exhibited a maximum value of 232 g/m3 h. For 1500 ppmv of H2S, 99{\%} removal was maintained during 90 days and complete biodegradation of VFAs was observed. A recovery of 60{\%} as sulfate was obtained due to the constant excess of O2 concentration in the system. Acetic and propionic acids as a sole source of carbon were also evaluated in the bioreactor at different inlet loadings (0-120 g/m3 h) obtaining a complete removal (99{\%}) for both. Microcosms biodegradation experiments conducted with VFAs demonstrated that acetic acid provided the highest biodegradation rate.},

However, the propionate degradation was rate-limiting step during the batch operation. The results of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that there was a correlation between the population of the genus Methanosarcina and the methane production rate coupled with acetate consumption during batch operation, and the results of terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) revealed that the increasing intensity of T-RF peaks of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was associated with a decrease in the level of C3-acids.},

While each of these strategies has provided varying degrees of stability or activity enhancement, the application of high pressure may be a complementary, synergistic, or an additive enzyme enhancement technique. Over 25 enzymes that have exhibited high pressure stabilization and/or activation were compiled. Each enzyme discussed responds differently to high pressure depending on the pressure range, temperature, source, solvent or media, and substrate. Possible mechanisms for pressure-induced stabilization and activation are discussed and compared with current enzyme enhancement techniques. The compiled evidence of high pressure enzyme enhancement in this review indicates that pressure is an effective reaction parameter with potential for greater utilization in enzyme catalysis.},

abstract = {The feasibility of adding crude glycerol from the biodiesel industry to the anaerobic digesters treating sewage sludge in wastewater treatment plants was studied in both batch and continuous experiments at 35 °C. Glycerol addition can boost biogas yields, if it does not exceed a limiting 1{\%} (v/v) concentration in the feed. Any further increase of glycerol causes a high imbalance in the anaerobic digestion process. The reactor treating the sewage sludge produced 1106 ± 36 ml CH4/d before the addition of glycerol and 2353 ± 94 ml CH4/d after the addition of glycerol (1{\%} v/v in the feed). The extra glycerol-COD added to the feed did not have a negative effect on reactor performance, but seemed to increase the active biomass (volatile solids) concentration in the system. Batch kinetic experiments showed that the maximum specific utilization rate ([mu]max) and the saturation constant (KS) of glycerol were 0.149 ± 0.015 h-1 and 0.276 ± 0.095 g/l, respectively. Comparing the estimated values with the kinetics constants for propionate reported in the literature, it can be concluded that glycerol uptake is not the rate-limiting step during the process.},

The six isolates exhibited significantly higher [mu]max and had higher affinity to acetate than the type strain M. thermophila TM-1T. Generally, the affinities of thermophilic Methanosarcina strains tested in this study cover a similar range to those reported in the literature for mesophilic Methanosarcina spp. with acetate as substrate. The strains isolated from plants treating mixtures of animal manures and industrial organic wastes had higher affinity for acetate and lower thresholds than strains isolated from reactors operating solely on manures.},

abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) is the most important substrate for biogas production in Germany. This study was conducted to determine the influence of harvest date and hybrid maturity on the yield and quality of maize biomass for anaerobic methane production. In 2004 and 2005, maize hybrids of widely contrasting maturity were grown on a loamy sand soil (Haplic Luvisol) near Braunschweig, Germany. Whole-plant yield was determined several times after female flowering and the biomass analysed for nutrient composition. The specific methane yield (SMY) was measured using 20 l batch digesters. In both experimental years, the late energy maize prototypes had a lower concentration of fat and protein, but higher concentration of ash, detergent fibre, and lignin as compared with the climatically adapted medium-early hybrids. Despite substantially different nutrient concentration among the maize hybrids, no clear-cut association existed between chemical composition and specific methane yield. Contrary to the medium-early hybrids, the late hybrids attained both maximum specific methane yield and maximum methane hectare yields at the final harvest date. In the very long growing season of 2004, the highest individual methane yield of 9370 N m3 ha-1 was obtained by the hybrid with the latest maturity used in the study. It appears that late energy maize, which can take full advantage of the growing season, is better suited for biogas production, provided that the whole-plant dry matter concentration is high enough to produce good quality silage.},

Combination of TS control of inoculum and batch operation during early days enabled the successful start-up operation without serious volatile fatty acid accumulation, followed by the stable continuous operation. However, the propionate degradation was rate-limiting step during the batch operation. The results of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that there was a correlation between the population of the genus Methanosarcina and the methane production rate coupled with acetate consumption during batch operation, and the results of terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) revealed that the increasing intensity of T-RF peaks of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was associated with a decrease in the level of C3-acids.},

abstract = {In the present work, the main objective was to evaluate a biofiltration system for removing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) contained in a gaseous stream from an anaerobic digestor (AD). The elimination of these compounds allowed the potential use of biogas while maintaining the methane (CH4) content throughout the process. The biodegradation of H2S was determined in the lava rock biofilter under two different empty bed residence times (EBRT). Inlet loadings lower than 200 g/m3 h at an EBRT of 81 s yielded a complete removal, attaining an elimination capacity (EC) of 142 g/m3 h, whereas at an EBRT of 31 s, a critical EC of 200 g/m3 h was reached and the EC obtained exhibited a maximum value of 232 g/m3 h. For 1500 ppmv of H2S, 99{\%} removal was maintained during 90 days and complete biodegradation of VFAs was observed. A recovery of 60{\%} as sulfate was obtained due to the constant excess of O2 concentration in the system. Acetic and propionic acids as a sole source of carbon were also evaluated in the bioreactor at different inlet loadings (0-120 g/m3 h) obtaining a complete removal (99{\%}) for both. Microcosms biodegradation experiments conducted with VFAs demonstrated that acetic acid provided the highest biodegradation rate.},

This work was conducted to design primer and probe sets for the detection of methanogens using a real-time PCR with the TaqMan system. Six group-specific methanogenic primer and probe sets were designed. These sets separately detect four orders (Methanococcales, Methanobacteriales, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosarcinales) along with two families (Methanosarcinaceae and Methanosaetaceae) of the order Methanosarcinales. We also designed the universal primer and probe sets that specifically detect the 16S rDNA of prokaryotes and of the domain Bacteria and Archaea, and which are fully compatible with the TaqMan real-time PCR system. Target-group specificity of each primer and probe set was empirically verified by testing DNA isolated from 28 archaeal cultures and by analyzing potential false results. In general, each primer and probe set was very specific to the target group. The primer and probe sets designed in this study can be used to detect and quantify the order-level (family-level in the case of Methanosarcinales) methanogenic groups in anaerobic biological processes and various environments.},

abstract = {The structure of pili from the archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis is unlike that of any bacterial pili. However, genetic analysis of the genes involved in the formation of these pili has been lacking until this study. Pili were isolated from a nonflagellated ($\Delta$flaK) mutant and shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to consist primarily of subunits with an apparent molecular mass of 17 kDa. In-frame deletions were created in three genes, MMP0233, MMP0236, and MMP0237, which encode proteins with bacterial type IV pilin-like signal peptides previously identified by in silico methodology as likely candidates for pilus structural proteins. Deletion of MMP0236 or MMP0237 resulted in mutant cells completely devoid of pili on the cell surface, while deletion of the third pilin-like gene, MMP0233, resulted in cells greatly reduced in the number of pili on the surface. Complementation with the deleted gene in each case returned the cells to a piliated state. Surprisingly, mass spectrometry analysis of purified pili identified the major structural pilin as another type IV pilin-like protein, MMP1685, whose gene is located outside the first pilus locus. This protein was found to be glycosylated with an N-linked branched pentasaccharide glycan. Deletion and complementation analysis confirmed that MMP1685 is required for piliation.},

The mtaA1, mtaA2, and mtbA genes of Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A encode putative methanol- or methylamine-specific MT2 enzymes. To address the in vivo roles of these genes in growth and methanogenesis from known substrates, we constructed and characterized mutants with deletions of each of these genes. The mtaA1 gene is required for growth on methanol, whereas mtaA2 was dispensable. However, the mtaA2 mutant had a reduced rate of methane production from methanol. Surprisingly, deletion of mtaA1 in combination with deletions of the genes encoding three methanol-specific MT1 isozymes led to lack of growth on acetate, suggesting that MT1 and MT2 enzymes might play an important role during growth on this substrate. The mtbA gene was required for dimethylamine and monomethylamine (MMA) utilization and was important, but not required, for trimethylamine utilization. Analysis of reporter gene fusions revealed that both mtaA1 and mtbA were expressed on all methanogenic substrates tested. However, mtaA1 expression was induced on methanol, while mtbA expression was down-regulated on MMA and acetate. mtaA2 was expressed at very low levels on all substrates. The mtaA1 transcript had a large 5' untranslated region (UTR) (275 bp), while the 5' UTR of the mtbA transcript was only 28 bp long.},

abstract = {To study whether trace element limitations are present in methanogenic granular sludge from full-scale anaerobic bioreactors, four different anaerobic granular sludges (Nedalco, Eerbeek, Hoogeveen and Heineken) were screened for their metal content and their response to the addition of a metal cocktail and more specifically to cobalt. Three different methanogenic substrates (methanol, acetate and H2/CO2) were used and the response to trace metal addition was monitored by on-line measurement of the changes in the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of the sludge. A significant increase of the SMA due to trace metal addition was observed only with the substrate methanol, especially addition of only cobalt had a great effect: the SMA with methanol of the Nedalco and Hoogeveen sludge increased from, respectively, 306 and 155 mg CH4-COD g VSS-1 d-1 to 535 and 334 mg CH4-COD g VSS-1 d-1 upon the addition of solely 5 [mu]M cobalt. In the Heineken sludge, a limitation for another element was present as well. The cobalt concentrations in the sludges were low compared to the other trace elements and could not be directly related to the response of the SMA. With acetate as the substrate and in the presence of cobalt (5 [mu]M) a reduction of the lag-phase was observed for the Nedalco, and more pronounced for the Heineken sludge. This indicates that cobalt is also important for the onset of the activity/growth of the acetotrophic methanogenic population. Screening of the trace metal content of anaerobic granular sludge in combination with the response of the SMA to trace metal addition is therefore a valuable tool to prevent and foresee trace metal limitation in anaerobic bioreactors.},

abstract = {Methanogenic archaea growing on ethanol or isopropanol as the electron donor for CO2 reduction to CH4 contain either an NADP-dependent or a coenzyme F420-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. We report here that in both groups of methanogens, the N5, N10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase and the N5, N10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase, two enzymes involved in CO2 reduction to CH4, are specific for F420. This raised the question how F420H2 is regenerated in the methanogens with an NADP-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. We found that these organisms contain catabolic activities of an enzyme catalyzing the reduction of F420 with NADPH. The F420-dependent NADP reductase from Methanogenium organophilum was purified and characterized. The N-terminal amino acid sequence showed 42{\%} sequence identity to a putative gene product in Methanococcus jannaschii, the total genome of which has recently been sequenced.},

The experimental design consisted of 5{\%} wt (Gli 5), 10{\%} wt (Gli 10), and 15{\%} wt (Gli 15) of crude glycerin added to cattle slurry, and one control digester without addition of crude glycerin. Anaerobic digestion was carried out in 4 laboratory size CSTR-type biogas digesters with a working volume of 3 L, in semi-continuous regime at mesophilic conditions, over a period of 10 weeks. The highest biogas yields (825.3 mL g-1 and 825.7 mL g-1, respectively) relative to mass of volatile compounds added, were produced by the treatments Gli 5 and Gli 10. The control treatment produced 268.6 mL g-1, whereas the treatment Gli 15 produced 387.9 mL g-1. This low value was due to the breakdown of the process. Compared to the control, methane contents was increased by 9.5{\%}, 14.3{\%}, and 14.6{\%}, respectively, for the treatments Gli 5, Gli 10, and Gli 15.},

abstract = {Biochemical evidence suggests that methanol catabolism in Methanosarcina species requires the concerted effort of methanol:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide methyltransferase (MtaB), a corrinoid-containing methyl-accepting protein (MtaC) and Co-methyl-5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide:2-mercapto-ethanesulphonic acid methyltransferase (MtaA). Here we show that Methanosarcina acetivorans possesses three operons encoding putative methanol-specific MtaB and corrinoid proteins: mtaCB1, mtaCB2 and mtaCB3. Deletion mutants lacking the three operons, in all possible combinations, were constructed and characterized. Strains deleted for any two of the operons grew on methanol, whereas strains lacking all three did not. Therefore, each operon encodes a bona fide methanol-utilizing MtaB/corrinoid protein pair. Most of the mutants were similar to the wild-type strain, with the exception of the DeltamtaCB1 DeltamtaCB2 double mutant, which grew more slowly and had reduced cell yields on methanol medium. However, all mutants displayed significantly longer lag times when switching from growth on trimethylamine to growth on methanol. This indicates that all three operons are required for wild-type growth on methanol and suggests that each operon has a distinct role in the metabolism of this substrate. The combined methanol:CoM methyltransferase activity of strains carrying only mtaCB1 was twofold higher than strains carrying only mtaCB2 and fourfold higher than strains carrying only mtaCB3. Interestingly, the presence of the mtaCB2 and mtaCB3 operons, in addition to the mtaCB1 operon, did not increase the overall methyltransferase activity, suggesting that these strains may be limited by MtaA availability. All deletion mutants were unaffected with respect to growth on trimethylamine and acetate corroborating biochemical evidence indicating that each methanogenic substrate has specific methyltransfer enzymes.},

@article{Shelton1984,
abstract = {A simple, generalized method was refined and validated to test whether an organic chemical was susceptible to anaerobic degradation to CH4 + CO2. The method used digested sewage sludge diluted to 10{\%} and incubated anaerobically in 160-ml serum bottles with 50 micrograms of C per ml of test chemical. Biodegradation was determined by the net increase in gas pressure in bottles with test chemicals over the pressure in nonamended sludge bottles. Gas production was measured by gas chromatography and by a pressure transducer. The latter method is recommended because of its speed, accuracy, and low cost. Sewage sludge from municipal digesters with 15- to 30-day retention times was found to be suitable. The sludge could be stored anaerobically at 4 degrees C for up to 4 weeks with satisfactory test results. p-Cresol, phthalic acid, and ethanol are suggested as reference chemicals to confirm sludge activity and method reliability. A revised anaerobic salts medium was developed which minimizes problems of a biological gas production (CO2), avoids precipitation, and meets the requirements of the anaerobic microbiota. When greater than 75{\%} of the theoretical gas production was observed, the chemical was judged to be degradable, and when 30 to 75{\%} of the expected gas was produced, it was termed partially degradable. This method has been tested on more than 100 chemicals of various physical properties and found to reproducibly determine anaerobic biodegradation potential. Of the chemicals tested, 46 were found to be anaerobically degraded. Sludges from nine different municipal treatment plants were surveyed for their ability to degrade nine chemicals which differed in susceptibility to degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {We have used genetic methods in Methanococcus maripaludis to study nitrogen metabolism and its regulation. We present evidence for a "nitrogen regulon" in Methanococcus and Methanobacterium species containing genes of nitrogen metabolism that are regulated coordinately at the transcriptional level via a common repressor binding site sequence, or operator. The implied mechanism for regulation resembles the general bacterial paradigm for repression, but contrasts with well-known mechanisms of nitrogen regulation in bacteria, which occur by activation. Genes in the nitrogen regulons include those for nitrogen fixation, glutamine synthetase, (methyl)ammonia transport, the regulatory protein GlnB, and ammonia-dependent NAD synthetase, as well as a gene of unknown function. We also studied the function of two novel GlnB homologues that are encoded within the nif gene cluster of diazotrophic methanogens. The phenotype resulting from a glnB null mutation in M. maripaludis provides direct evidence that glnB-like genes are involved in "ammonia switch-off," the post-transcriptional inhibition of nitrogen fixation upon addition of ammonia. Finally, we show that the gene nifX is not required for nitrogen fixation, in agreement with findings in several bacteria. These studies illustrate the utility of genetic methods in M. maripaludis and show the enhanced perspective that studies in the Archaea can bring to known biological systems.},

The anaerobic digestion of apple pulp was investigated for biogas production. This paper presents the results where apple pulp was co-digested with slaughterhouse waste (pig intestine and bovine stomach content) in a biogas laboratory unit (10 l CSTR reactor). The production of biogas has reached very satisfactory values during the whole test (0.8m(3)kg(-1)OTS), verifying that the process is kept in stable conditions of pH (near 8.0), and the volatile fatty acids was always underneath 3000 mg/l, when the pulp amount was lower than 100g in mesophilic conditions. The fat concentration into the digester remained always below the value that causes inhibition of the methanogenic bacteria, 500 mg/l. Finally, methane concentration (77-80{\%}) and H(2)S concentration (400 ppm) in the biogas, they were similar to those obtained when the test was run out in the absence of apple pulp. The process efficiency with respect to COD removal was high, near 80{\%} of the total COD. Finally, inhibitory effects of methanogenic bacteria were observed when pulp concentration was around 10{\%} in the input material.},

A simulation study based on the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) was done in order to show its applicability to lignocellulosic biomass. Therefore, the influent was fractioned by established fodder analysis (Weender analysis and van Soest method). ADM1 was modified with a separate compound of inert decay products similar to the approach of Activated Sludge Model No. 1 (ASM1). Furthermore, a function, which described the influence of solids on the process of hydrolysis, has been integrated to reproduce reliable ammonium concentrations. The model was calibrated by using the modified Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient to evaluate simulation quality. It was possible to fit observed data by changing only hydrogen inhibition constants and the maximum acetate uptake rate. The extended ADM1 model showed good agreement with measurements and was suitable for modeling anaerobic digestion of grass silage.},

However, less inhibition was noted when pesticides were added during early exponential growth phase. Addition to culture tubes of Co, Ni, or Mo at 2 muM produced 64, 41, or 17{\%}, respectively, more CH(4) than that produced in tubes lacking the corresponding trace element.

abstract = {Cell suspensions of Methanobrevibacter arboriphilus catalyzed the reduction of O(2) with H(2) at a maximal specific rate of 0.4 U (micromol/min) per mg protein with an apparent K(m) for O(2) of 30 microM. The reaction was not inhibited by cyanide. The oxidase activity was traced back to a coenzyme F(420)-dependent enzyme that was purified to apparent homogeneity and that catalyzed the oxidation of 2 F(420)H(2) with 1 O(2) to 2 F(420) and 2 H(2)O. The apparent K(m) for F(420) was 30 microM and that for O(2) was 2 microM with a V(max) of 240 U/mg at 37 degrees C and pH 7.6, the pH optimum of the oxidase. The enzyme did not use NADH or NADPH as electron donor or H(2)O(2) as electron acceptor and was not inhibited by cyanide. The 45-kDa protein, whose gene was cloned and sequenced, contained 1 FMN per mol and harbored a binuclear iron center as indicated by the sequence motif H-X-E-X-D-X(62)-H-X(18)-D-X(60)-H. Sequence comparisons revealed that the F(420)H(2) oxidase from M. arboriphilus is phylogenetically closely related to FprA from Methanothermobacter marburgensis (71{\%} sequence identity), a 45-kDa flavoprotein of hitherto unknown function, and to A-type flavoproteins from bacteria (30-40{\%}), which all have dioxygen reductase activity. With heterologously produced FprA from M. marburgensis it is shown that this protein is also a highly efficient F(420)H(2) oxidase and that it contains 1 FMN and 2 iron atoms. The presence of F(420)H(2) oxidase in methanogenic archaea may explain why some methanogens, e.g., the Methanobrevibacter species in the termite hindgut, cannot only tolerate but thrive under microoxic conditions.},

abstract = {The aim of this laboratory-scale study was to investigate the long-term anaerobic fermentation of an extremely sour substrate, an energy crop, for continuous production of methane (CH4) as a source of renewable energy. The sugar beet silage was used as the mono-substrate, which had a low pH of around 3.3–3.4, without the addition of manure. The mesophilic biogas digester was operated in a hydraulic retention time (HRT) range between 15 and 9.5 days, and an organic loading rate (OLR) range of between 6.33 and 10 g VS l−1 d−1. The highest specific gas production rate (spec. GPR) and CH4 content were 0.67 l g VS−1 d−1 and 74{\%}, respectively, obtained at an HRT of 9.5 days and OLR of 6.35 g VS l−1 d−1. The digester worked within the neutral pH range as well. Since this substrate lacked the availability of macro and micro nutrients, and the buffering capacity as well, external supplementation was definitely required to provide a stable and efficient operation, as provided using NH4Cl and KHCO3 in this case. The findings of this ongoing long-term fermentation of an extremely acidic biomass substrate without manure addition have reflected crucial information about how to appropriately maintain the operational and particularly the environmental parameters in an agricultural biogas plant. },

abstract = {Methanococcus maripaludis, an H(2)- and formate-utilizing methanogen, produced H(2) at high rates from formate. The rates and kinetics of H(2) production depended upon the growth conditions, and H(2) availability during growth was a major factor. Specific activities of resting cells grown with formate or H(2) were 0.4 to 1.4 U mg(-1) (dry weight). H(2) production in formate-grown cells followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the concentration of formate required for half-maximal activity (K(f)) was 3.6 mM. In contrast, in H(2)-grown cells this process followed sigmoidal kinetics, and the K(f) was 9 mM. A key enzyme for formate-dependent H(2) production was formate dehydrogenase, Fdh. H(2) production and growth were severely reduced in a mutant containing a deletion of the gene encoding the Fdh1 isozyme, indicating that it was the primary Fdh. In contrast, a mutant containing a deletion of the gene encoding the Fdh2 isozyme possessed near-wild-type activities, indicating that this isozyme did not play a major role. H(2) production by a mutant containing a deletion of the coenzyme F(420)-reducing hydrogenase Fru was also severely reduced, suggesting that the major pathway of H(2) production comprised Fdh1 and Fru. Because a Deltafru-Deltafrc mutant retained 10{\%} of the wild-type activity, an additional pathway is present. Mutants possessing deletions of the gene encoding the F(420)-dependent methylene-H(4)MTP dehydrogenase (Mtd) or the H(2)-forming methylene-H(4)MTP dehydrogenase (Hmd) also possessed reduced activity, which suggested that this second pathway was comprised of Fdh1-Mtd-Hmd. In contrast to H(2) production, the cellular rates of methanogenesis were unaffected in these mutants, which suggested that the observed H(2) production was not a direct intermediate of methanogenesis. In conclusion, high rates of formate-dependent H(2) production demonstrated the potential of M. maripaludis for the microbial production of H(2) from formate.},

abstract = {Biogas is a biofuel with a high energy value and basically consisting of methane, which can be used as a renewable energy source as a substitute for natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas. It can be produced by anaerobic digestion of agricultural organic waste or manure in rural areas, where it can be used to generate electric, thermal or mechanical energy. It can also be generated in landfills from the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes and used as an alternative energy source in urban areas. Industrialized and urbanized areas are afflicted by serious environmental problems associated with the generation of organic residues. Anaerobic microorganisms can degrade pollutants resulting in two kinds of products, i.e., digested sludge and biogas, which can be exploited as a soil fertilizer and a renewable energy source, respectively. The correct management of residual waste involves high costs, and inadequate treatment and storage can compromise its quality. Environmental agencies have been encouraging the dissemination of anaerobic digesters to produce biogas from organic residues and the use of the resulting sludge as fertilizer since it is able to destroy pathogenic agents and reduce the humidity level. This review aims to evaluate the production capability of biogas and its application as an alternative energy source in rural and urban areas.},

Lactose, cheese whey powder (CWP) and glucose were used as substrates and heat-treated anaerobic granular sludge as inoculum. For lactose, 3.6 mol H2/mol lactose and 5.6 mmol H2/L/h were found at pH 7.5 and 5 g lactose/L. CWP yielded 3.1 mol H2/mol lactose at pH 6 and 15 g CWP/L while 8.1 mmol H2/L/h were attained at pH 7.5 and 25 g CWP/L. Glucose yielded 1.46 mol H2/mol substrate (pH 7.5, 5 g glucose/L), with a VHPR of 8.9 mmol H2/L/h, at pH 8.12 and 15 g glucose/L. Acetic and butyric acids were the main organic metabolites detected. HMY and VHPR obtained in this study were found at initial pH above the reported optimum pH value for hydrogen production. These findings could be of significance when alkaline pretreatments are performed on organic feedstock by eliminating the need to lower the pH to acidic levels before fermentation start-up.},

abstract = {We tested at full-scale the innovative Focused Pulsed (FP) technology for pre-treating waste sludge in order to improve methane gas production and biosolids reduction in sludge digestion, but without incurring problems of odors, toxicity, and high costs for chemical or energy consumption. FP pre-treatment of a mixture of primary and secondary sludge increased the soluble COD by 160{\%} and DOC 120{\%} over the control. FP pre-treatment of 63{\%} of the input waste sludge increased biogas production by over 40{\%} and reduced biosolids requiring disposal by 30{\%} when compared to the plant baseline. FP pre-treatment also correlated with a shift of the bacterial and archaeal communities. The most significant change was that the acetate-cleaving Methanosaeta became the dominant methanogen. Full FP pre-treatment should increase biogas production and biosolids removal by 60{\%} and 40{\%}, respectively. Full FP pre-treatment should generate energy benefits of at least 2.7 times and as high as 18 times the FP energy input, depending on heat recovery from FP treatment. For a plant treating 76,000 m3/d of wastewater (380 m3-sludge/d), FP treatment should generate an annual economic benefit of approximately {\$}540,000 net of electricity and other operating and maintenance costs.

abstract = {Methanogenic bioreactor communities were used as model ecosystems to evaluate the relationship between functional stability and community structure. Replicated methanogenic bioreactor communities with two different community structures were established. The effect of a substrate loading shock on population dynamics in each microbial community was examined by using morphological analysis, small-subunit (SSU) rRNA oligonucleotide probes, amplified ribosomal DNA (rDNA) restriction analysis (ARDRA), and partial sequencing of SSU rDNA clones. One set of replicated communities, designated the high-spirochete (HS) set, was characterized by good replicability, a high proportion of spiral and short thin rod morphotypes, a dominance of spirochete-related SSU rDNA genes, and a high percentage ofMethanosarcina-related SSU rRNA. The second set of communities, designated the low-spirochete (LS) set, was characterized by incomplete replicability, higher morphotype diversity dominated by cocci, a predominance of Streptococcus-related and deeply branching Spirochaetales-related SSU rDNA genes, and a high percentage of Methanosaeta-related SSU rRNA. In the HS communities, glucose perturbation caused a dramatic shift in the relative abundance of fermentative bacteria, with temporary displacement of spirochete-related ribotypes byEubacterium-related ribotypes, followed by a return to the preperturbation community structure. The LS communities were less perturbed, with Streptococcus-related organisms remaining prevalent after the glucose shock, although changes in the relative abundance of minor members were detected by morphotype analysis. A companion paper demonstrates that the more stable LS communities were less functionally stable than the HS communities (S. A. Hashsham, A. S. Fernandez, S. L. Dollhopf, F. B. Dazzo, R. F.

abstract = {A study of the second step or methanogenic stage of a two-stage anaerobic digestion process treating two-phase olive oil mill solid residue (OMSR) was conducted at mesophilic temperature (35 degrees C). The substrate fed to the methanogenic step was the effluent from a hydrolytic-acidogenic reactor operating at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 12.9 g chemical oxygen demand (COD) L(-1) d(-1) and at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12.4 days; these OLR and HRT were found to be the best values to achieve the maximum total volatile fatty acid concentration (14.5 g L(-1) expressed as acetic acid) with a high concentration in acetic acid (57.5{\%} of the total concentration) as the principal precursor of methane. The methanogenic stage was carried out in an anaerobic stirred tank reactor containing saponite as support media for the immobilization of microorganisms. OLRs of between 0.8 and 22.0 g COD L(-1) d(-1) were studied. These OLRs corresponded to HRTs of between 142.9 and 4.6 days. The methanogenic reactor operated with high stability for OLRs lower than 20.0 g COD L(-1) d(-1). This behaviour was shown by the total volatile fatty acids/total alkalinity ratio, whose values were always kept 0.12 for HRTs{\textgreater}4.6 days. The total COD (T-COD) removed was in the range of 94.3-61.3{\%} and the volatile solids (VS) removed between 92.8{\%} and 56.1{\%} for OLRs between 0.8 and 20.0 g COD L(-1) d(-1). In the same way, a reduction of 43.8{\%} was achieved for phenolic content. The low concentration of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) observed (below 1 g L(-1) expressed as CH(3)COOH) in the methanogenic reactor effluents showed the high percentage of consumption and conversion of these acids to methane. A methane yield of 0.268+/-0.003 L CH(4) at standard temperature and pressure conditions (STP) g(-1) COD eliminated was achieved.},

abstract = {Thermophilic propionate-oxidizing, proton-reducing bacteria were enriched from the granular methanogenic sludge of a bench-scale upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactor operated at 55{\{}degrees{\}}C with a mixture of volatile fatty acids as feed. Thermophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogens had a high decay rate. Therefore, stable, thermophilic propionate-oxidizing cultures could not be obtained by using the usual enrichment procedures. Stable and reproducible cultivation was possible by enrichment in hydrogen-pregrown cultures of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum {\{}Delta{\}}H which were embedded in precipitates of FeS, achieved by addition of FeCl2 to the media. The propionate-oxidizing bacteria formed spores which resisted pasteurization for 30 min at 90{\{}degrees{\}}C or 10 min at 100{\{}degrees{\}}C. Highly purified cultures were obtained with either M. thermoautotrophicum {\{}Delta{\}}H or Methanobacterium thermoformicicum Z245 as the syntrophic partner organism. The optimum temperature for the two cultures was 55{\{}degrees{\}}C. Maximum specific growth rates of cultures with M. thermoautotrophicum {\{}Delta{\}}H were somewhat lower than those of cultures with M. thermoformicicum Z245 (0.15 and 0.19 day-1, respectively). Growth rates were even higher (0.32 day-1) when aceticlastic methanogens were present as well. M. thermoautotrophicum {\{}Delta{\}}H is an obligately hydrogen-utilizing methanogen, showing that interspecies hydrogen transfer is the mechanism by which reducing equivalents are channelled from the acetogens to this methanogen. Boundaries of hydrogen partial pressures at which propionate oxidation occurred were between 6 and 34 Pa. Formate had a strong inhibitory effect on propionate oxidation in cultures with M. thermoautotrophicum. Inhibition by formate was neutralized by addition of the formate-utilizing methanogen or by addition of fumarate. Results indicate that formate inhibited succinate oxidation to fumarate, an intermediate step in the biochemical pathway of propionate oxidation.},

abstract = {For modeling of biological processes that operate close to the dynamic equilibrium (eg. anaerobic processes), it is critical to prevent the prediction of positive reaction rates when the reaction has already reached dynamic equilibrium. Traditional Michaelis-Menten based models were found to violate the laws of thermodynamics as they predicted positive reaction rates for reactions that were endergonic due to high endproduct concentrations. The inclusion of empirical "product inhibition factors" as suggested by previous work could not prevent this problem. This paper compares the predictions of the Michaelis-Menten Model (with and without product inhibition factors) and the Equilibrium Based Model (which has a thermodynamic term introduced into its rate equation) with experimental results of reactions in anaerobic bacterial environments. In contrast to the Michaelis-Menten based models that used traditional inhibition factors, the Equilibrium Based Model correctly predicted the nature and the degree of inhibition due to endproduct accumulation. Moreover, this model also correctly predicted when reaction rates must be zero due to the free energy change of the conversion reaction being zero. With these added advantages, the Equilibrium Based Model thus seemed to provide a scientifically correct and more realistic basis for a variety of models that describe anaerobic biosystems.},

abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/bit.22108.abs A fuzzy logic control (FLC) system was developed at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW Hamburg) for operation of biogas reactors running on energy crops. Three commercially available measuring parameters, namely pH, the methane (CH4) content, and the specific gas production rate (spec. GPR = m3/kg VS/day) were included. The objective was to avoid stabilization of pH with use of buffering supplements, like lime or manure. The developed FLC system can cover most of all applications, such as a careful start-up process and a gentle recovery strategy after a severe reactor failure, also enabling a process with a high organic loading rate (OLR) and a low hydraulic retention time (HRT), that is, a high throughput anaerobic digestion process with a stable pH and CH4 content. A precondition for a high load process was the concept of interval feeding, for example, with 8 h of interval. The FLC system was proved to be reliable during the long term fermentation studies over 3 years in one-stage, completely stirred tank reactors (CSTR) with acidic beet silage as mono-input (pH 3.3–3.4). During fermentation of the fodder beet silage (FBS), a stable HRT of 6.0 days with an OLR of up to 15 kg VS/m3/day and a volumetric GPR of 9 m3/m3/day could be reached. The FLC enabled an automatic recovery of the digester after two induced severe reactor failures. In another attempt to prove the feasibility of the FLC, substrate FBS was changed to sugar beet silage (SBS), which had a substantially lower buffering capacity than that of the FBS. With SBS, the FLC accomplished a stable fermentation at a pH level between 6.5 and 6.6, and a volatile fatty acid level (VFA) below 500 mg/L, but the FLC had to interact and to change the substrate dosage permanently. In a further experiment, the reactor temperature was increased from 41 to 50°C. Concomitantly, the specific GPR, pH and CH4 dropped down. Finally, the FLC automatically enabled a complete recovery in 16 days. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2009; 102: 736–748. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Methane hydrate found in marine sediments is thought to contain gigaton quantities of methane and is considered an important potential fuel source and climate-forcing agent. Much of the methane in hydrates is biogenic, so models that predict the presence and distribution of hydrates require accurate rates of in situ methanogenesis. We estimated the in situ methanogenesis rates in Hydrate Ridge (HR) sediments by coupling experimentally derived minimal rates of methanogenesis to methanogen biomass determinations for discrete locations in the sediment column. When starved in a biomass recycle reactor, Methanoculleus submarinus produced ca. 0.017 fmol methane/cell/day. Quantitative PCR (QPCR) directed at the methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (mcrA) indicated that 75{\%} of the HR sediments analyzed contained {\textless}1,000 methanogens/g. The highest numbers of methanogens were found mostly from sediments {\textless}10 m below seafloor. By considering methanogenesis rates for starved methanogens (adjusted to account for in situ temperatures) and the numbers of methanogens at selected depths, we derived an upper estimate of {\textless}4.25 fmol methane produced/g sediment/day for the samples with fewer methanogens than the QPCR method could detect. The actual rates could vary depending on the real number of methanogens and various seafloor parameters that influence microbial activity. However, our calculated rate is lower than rates previously reported for such sediments and close to the rate derived using geochemical modeling of the sediments. These data will help to improve models that predict microbial gas generation in marine sediments and determine the potential influence of this source of methane on the global carbon cycle.},

abstract = {A study of the second step or methanogenic stage of a two-stage anaerobic digestion process treating two-phase olive oil mill solid residue (OMSR) was conducted at mesophilic temperature (35 degrees C). The substrate fed to the methanogenic step was the effluent from a hydrolytic-acidogenic reactor operating at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 12.9 g chemical oxygen demand (COD) L(-1) d(-1) and at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12.4 days; these OLR and HRT were found to be the best values to achieve the maximum total volatile fatty acid concentration (14.5 g L(-1) expressed as acetic acid) with a high concentration in acetic acid (57.5{\%} of the total concentration) as the principal precursor of methane. The methanogenic stage was carried out in an anaerobic stirred tank reactor containing saponite as support media for the immobilization of microorganisms. OLRs of between 0.8 and 22.0 g COD L(-1) d(-1) were studied. These OLRs corresponded to HRTs of between 142.9 and 4.6 days. The methanogenic reactor operated with high stability for OLRs lower than 20.0 g COD L(-1) d(-1). This behaviour was shown by the total volatile fatty acids/total alkalinity ratio, whose values were always kept 0.12 for HRTs{\textgreater}4.6 days. The total COD (T-COD) removed was in the range of 94.3-61.3{\%} and the volatile solids (VS) removed between 92.8{\%} and 56.1{\%} for OLRs between 0.8 and 20.0 g COD L(-1) d(-1). In the same way, a reduction of 43.8{\%} was achieved for phenolic content. The low concentration of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) observed (below 1 g L(-1) expressed as CH(3)COOH) in the methanogenic reactor effluents showed the high percentage of consumption and conversion of these acids to methane. A methane yield of 0.268+/-0.003 L CH(4) at standard temperature and pressure conditions (STP) g(-1) COD eliminated was achieved.},

This difference was due to lack of propionate conversion by sludge from R2. No difference in the acetate and butyrate conversion capacity of both reactors was observed. The conversion of acetate, propionate and methanol were stimulated by the continuous addition of metals to the influent, as sludge of R1 had higher maximum specific activity values compared to sludge of R2. However, both sludges had a similar maximum specific activity with buryrate. Surprisingly, maximum specific activity tests using individual trace metals showed that the addition of a particular trace element in the activity test medium did not affect the degradation rates of a specific substrate, i.e. acetate, propionate, butyrate and methanol},

The thermochemical pretreatment gave the best result among three methods in the combined WAS, i.e., the VSS was solubilized by 40–50{\%} and the methane production incresed by more than 200{\%} over the control when the WAS was heated at 130 °C for 5 minutes with the dose 0.3 g NaOH/g VSS. In the domestic WAS, the VSS solubilization rate was 70–80{\%} but the increase of the methane production was about 30{\%} after thermochemically pretreated. The domestic WAS consists of 41{\%} protein, 25{\%} lipid and 14{\%} carbohydrate on COD basis, and the solubilization rate of protein, which is the largest constituent of the WAS, was 63{\%} in the thermochemical pretreatment. Although the effect of the thermochemical pretreatment on the methane production was higher to the combined WAS than to the domestic WAS, the methane production rate was 21.9 ml CH4/g VSSwas{\textperiodcentered}day in the domestic WAS and 12.8 ml CH4/g VSSwas{\textperiodcentered}day in the combined WAS. },

abstract = {Energetic and reaction-rate interactions between hydrogenic (hydrogen-producing) and hydrogenotrophic (hydrogen-consuming) bacteria were investigated in five perturbation experiments performed on steady-state, mixed-culture methanogenic CSTRs receiving ethanol, propionate, or both hydrogenic substrates. When a large quantity of propionate was suddenly added to a propionatefed CSTR, P(H(2) ) increased to 10(-4) atm and propionate oxidation remained energetically favorable. When ethanol was added to a CSTR receiving ethanol, P(H(2) ) rose to 6.3 x 10(-3) atm within 5 h. In both perturbations, P(H(2) ) remained at levels such that oxidation of the hydrogenic substrate remained energetically favorable throughout the transient. Sudden increase in ethanol concentration in the ethanol- and propionate-fed CSTR resulted in an increase in P(H(2) ) such that propionate oxidation became energetically unfavorable and was blocked. Propionate utilization resumed when the added ethanol was depleted and P(H(2) ) returned to its previous steady-state levels. Ethanol perturbation of ethanol- and propionate-fed CSTRs led to the formation of reduced products, including n-propanol and four-through seven-carbon n-carboxylic acids, when P(H(2) ) was elevated; these products disappeared after P(H(2) ) returned to previous, steady-state levels. The transformations were consistent with reaction energetics. Reduced product formation may have been a sink for reducing equivalents, as an alternative to oxidation for propionate utilization, as indicated by an electron equivalents balance over the time course of experiments.},

Due to the high KOH concentration of this by-product, H3PO4 was added to recover this alkaline catalyst as agricultural fertilizer (potassium phosphates). Although it would not be economically viable, a volume of glycerol was distilled and utilised as reference substrate. The anaerobic revalorisation of glycerol using granular sludge achieved a biodegradability of around 100{\%}, while the methane yield coefficient was 0.306 m3 CH4/kg acidified glycerol. Anaerobic digestion could be a good option for revalorising this available, impure and low priced by-product derived from the surplus of biodiesel companies.

abstract = {A microbial fuel cell (MFC) was constructed to investigate the possible generation of electricity using cattle dung as a substrate. After 30 days of operation, stable electricity was generated, and the maximum volumetric power density was 0.220 W/m(3). The total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal and coulombic efficiency (CE) of the MFC reached 73.9±1.8{\%} and 2.79±0.6{\%}, respectively, after 120 days of operation. Acetate was the main metabolite in the anolyte, and other volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (propionate and butyrate) were present in minor amounts. The PCR-DGGE analysis indicated that the following five groups of microbes were present: Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the sample; specifically, 36.3{\%} and 24.2{\%} of the sequences obtained were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, respectively. Clostridium sp., Pseudomonas luteola and Ochrobactrum pseudogrignonense were the most dominant groups during the electricity generation process. The diversity of archaea dramatically decreased after 20 days of operation. The detected archaea were hydrogenotrophic methanogens, and the Methanobacterium genus disappeared during the periods of stable electricity generation via acidogenesis.},

abstract = {All methanogenic Archaea examined to date rely on methanogenesis as their sole means of energy conservation. Among these are ones that use carbon monoxide as a growth substrate, producing methane via a pathway that involves hydrogen as an intermediate. To further examine the role of hydrogen in this process, we tested the ability of Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A, a metabolically versatile methanogen devoid of significant hydrogen metabolism, to use CO as a growth substrate. M. acetivorans grew on CO to high cell densities (approximately 1 x 10(8) per ml) with a doubling time of approximately 24 h. Surprisingly, acetate and formate, rather than methane, were the major metabolic end products as shown by 13C NMR studies and enzymatic analysis of culture supernatants. Methane formation surpassed acetate/formate formation only when the cultures entered stationary growth phase, strongly suggesting that M. acetivorans conserves energy by means of this acetogenic and formigenic process. Resting cell experiments showed that methane production decreased linearly with increasing CO partial pressures, consistent with inhibition of methanogenesis by CO. Transposon-induced M. acetivorans mutants with lesions in the operon encoding phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase failed to use either acetate or CO as growth substrates, indicating that these enzymes are required for both aceticlastic methanogenesis and carboxidotrophic acetogenesis. These findings greatly extend our concept of energy conservation and metabolic versatility in the methanogenic Archaea.},

abstract = {Biological sulfate reduction is widely used for treating sulfate-containing wastewaters from industries such as mining, tannery, pulp and paper, and textiles. In biological reduction, sulfate is converted to hydrogen sulfide as the end product. The process is, therefore, ideally suited for treating metal-containing wastewater from which heavy metals are simultaneously removed through the formation of metal sulfides. Metal sulfide precipitates are more stable than metal hydroxides that are sensitive to pH change. Theoretically, conversion of 1 mol of sulfate requires 0.67 mol of chemical oxygen demand or electron donors. Sulfate rich wastewaters are usually deficient in electron donors and require external addition of electron donors in order to achieve complete sulfate reduction. This paper reviews various electron donors employed in biological sulfate reduction. Widely used electron donors include hydrogen, methanol, ethanol, acetate, lactate, propionate, butyrate, sugar, and molasses. The selection criteria for suitable electron donors are discussed.},

At lipid loading rates exceeding 2-3 kg COD m-3 day-1, total sludge wash-out occurred. At lower loading rates the system was unreliable, due to unpredictable sludge flotation. EGSB reactors do fulfil the requirements of mixing and contact. They accommodate space loading rates up to 30 kg COD m-3 day-1 during digestion of caprate or laurate as sole substrate, at COD removal efficiencies of 83-91{\%}, and can be operated at hydraulic residence times of 2 h without any problems. Augmentation of granular sludge in lab-scale EGSB reactors was demonstrated. The new granules had excellent settling properties.

The theoretical considerations which influence the outcome of competition between sulphate reducers and fermentative, syntrophic, homoacetogenic and methanogenic bacteria are discussed. The actual outcome, under the varying influent organic composition and strength and sulfate concentrations which prevail during digestion of industrial wastewaters, may be quite different to that predicted by thermodynamic or kinetic considerations.

abstract = {Since biogas production is becoming increasingly important the understanding of anaerobic digestion processes is fundamental. However, large-scale digesters often lack online sensor equipment to monitor key parameters. Furthermore the possibility to selectively change fermenting parameter settings in order to investigate methane output or microbial changes is limited. In the present study we examined the possibility to investigate the microbial community of a large scale (750,000 L) digester within a laboratory small-scale approach. We studied the short-term response of the downscaled communities on various fatty acids and its effects on gas production and compared it with data from the original digester sludge. Even high loads of formic acid led to distinct methane formation, whereas high concentrations of other acids (acetic, butyric, propionic acid) caused a marked inhibition of methanogenesis coupled with an increase in hydrogen concentration. Molecular microbial techniques (DGGE/quantitative real-time-PCR) were used to monitor the microbial community changes which were related to data from GC and HPLC analysis. DGGE band patterns showed that the same microorganisms which were already dominant in the original digester re-established again in the lab-scale experiment. Very few microorganisms dominated the whole fermenting process and species diversity was not easily influenced by moderate varying fatty acid amendments--Methanoculleus thermophilus being the most abundant species throughout the variants. MCR-copy number determined via quantitative real-time-PCR--turned out to be a reliable parameter for quantification of methanogens, even in a very complex matrix like fermenter sludge. Generally the downscaled batch approach was shown to be appropriate to investigate microbial communities from large-scale digesters.},

abstract = {Two-phase anaerobic digestion of cheese whey was investigated in a system consisting of a stirred acidogenic reactor followed by a stirred methanogenic reactor, the latter being coupled to a membrane filtration system to enable removal of soluble effluent whilst retaining solids. The acidogenic reactor was operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of one day, giving maximum acidification of 52.25{\%} with up to 5 g/l volatile fatty acids, of which 63.7{\%} was acetic acid and 24.7{\%} was propionic acid. The methanogenic reactor received an organic load up to 19.78 g COD/ld, corresponding to a HRT of 4 days, at which 79{\%} CODs and 83{\%} BOD(5) removal efficiencies were obtained. Average removals of COD, BOD(5) and TSS in the two-phase anaerobic digestion process were 98.5{\%}, 99{\%} and 100{\%}, respectively. The daily biogas production exceeded 10 times reactor volume and biogas methane content was greater than 70{\%}.},

The methods of pretreatment studied are NaOH addition (chemical), heating (thermal) and heating with NaOH addition (thermochemical) to the domestic WAS and to the combined WAS from domestic, commercial and industrial wastewaters. The thermochemical pretreatment gave the best result among three methods in the combined WAS, i.e., the VSS was solubilized by 40–50{\%} and the methane production incresed by more than 200{\%} over the control when the WAS was heated at 130 °C for 5 minutes with the dose 0.3 g NaOH/g VSS. In the domestic WAS, the VSS solubilization rate was 70–80{\%} but the increase of the methane production was about 30{\%} after thermochemically pretreated. The domestic WAS consists of 41{\%} protein, 25{\%} lipid and 14{\%} carbohydrate on COD basis, and the solubilization rate of protein, which is the largest constituent of the WAS, was 63{\%} in the thermochemical pretreatment. Although the effect of the thermochemical pretreatment on the methane production was higher to the combined WAS than to the domestic WAS, the methane production rate was 21.9 ml CH4/g VSSwas{\textperiodcentered}day in the domestic WAS and 12.8 ml CH4/g VSSwas{\textperiodcentered}day in the combined WAS. },

@article{Adney1991,
abstract = {Abstract  Anaerobic digestion represents one of several commercially viable processes to convert woody biomass, agricultural wastes, and municipal solid wastes to methane gas, a useful energy source. This process occurs in the absence of oxygen, and is substantially less energy intensive than aerobic biological processes designed for disposal purposes. The anaerobic conversion process is a result of the synergistic effects of various microorganisms, which serve as a consortium. The rate-limiting step of this conversion process has been identified as the hydrolysis of cellulose, the major polymeric component of most biomass and waste feedstocks. Improvements in process economics therefore rely on improving the kinetic and physicochemical characteristics of cellulose degrading enzymes. The most thoroughly studied cellulase enzymes are produced by aerobic fungi, namelyTrichoderma reesei. However, the pH and temperature optima of fungal cellulases make them incompatible for use in anaerobic digestion systems, and the major populations of microorganisms involved in cellulase enzyme production under anaerobic digestion conditions are various bacterial producers. The current state of understanding of the major groups of bacterial cellulase producers is reviewed in this paper. Also addressed in this review are recently developed methods for the assessment of actual cellulase activity levels, reflective of the digester “hydrolytic potential,” using a series of detergent extractive procedures.},

In this study we have investigated, on a laboratory scale, the anaerobic co-digestion of olive mill wastewater (OMW) with olive mill solid waste (OMSW) using semi-continuous, feeding, tubular digesters operated at mesophilic temperatures. Each digester was fed with an influent, composed of OMW and OMSW, at an organic loading rate (OLR) varying between 0.67 and 6.67 g COD/l/d. The hydraulic retention times (HRT) were 12, 24 and 36 days. The TCOD concentrations of OMW used as the main substrate were 24, 56 and 80 g COD/l; the amount of the dry OMSW used as a co-substrate was fixed to approximately 56 g/l of OMW. The results indicated that the best methane production was about 0.95 l/l/day obtained at an OLR = 4.67 g COD/l/d, corresponding to influent TCOD = 56 g COD/l at an HRT = 12d. In contrast, the maximum TCOD removal efficiency (89{\%}) was achieved at an OLR = 0.67 g COD/l/d, corresponding to influent TCOD = 24 g COD/l at an HRT = 36 d. Moreover, the inhibition of biogas production was observed at the highest OLR studied.},

Without sulfate and with both sulfate and molybdate, lactate was rapidly consumed, and propionate and acetate were produced; whereas with sulfate alone, only acetate accumulated. Propionate oxidation was strongly accelerated by the presence of sulfate, but sulfate had no effect on acetate consumption even when methanogenesis was inhibited by chloroform. The methane production was not affected by the presence of sulfate. Counts of lactate- and propionate-oxidizing sulfate-reducing bacteria in the mixed culture gave 4.5 X 10(8) and 1.5 X 10(6) viable cells per ml, respectively. The number of lactate-oxidizing fermentative bacteria was 2.2 X 10(7) viable cells per ml, showing that sulfate-reducing bacteria outcompete fermentative bacteria for lactate in the ecosystem studied. The number of acetoclastic methanogens was 3.5 X 10(8) viable cells per ml, but only 2.5 X 10(4) sulfate reducers were counted on acetate, showing that acetotrophic methanogens completely predominated over acetate-oxidizing sulfate-reducing bacteria.

A UASB reactor (30 °C; pH 7) was operated for 261 days at a 12-h hydraulic retention time (HRT). The loading rate was increased stepwise from 2.6 g chemical oxygen demand (COD){\textperiodcentered}L reactor−1{\textperiodcentered}d−1 to 7.8 g COD{\textperiodcentered}L reactor−1{\textperiodcentered}d−1. Cobalt deprivation had a strong impact on the methanogenic activity of the sludge. In batch tests, the methanogenic activity of the sludge with methanol as the substrate increased 5.3 (day 28) and 2.1 (day 257) times by addition of 840 nM of cobalt. The sludge had an apparent Km for cobalt of 948 nM after 28 days of operation and 442 nM at the end of the run. Cobalt deprivation during 54 days of operation led to a methanol conversion efficiency of only 55{\%}. Continuous addition of cobalt (330 nM) for 33 days improved the methanol removal efficiency to 100{\%}. In this period of cobalt dosing, the cobalt concentration in the sludge increased 2.7 times up to 32 $\mu$g{\textperiodcentered}g TSS−1. Upon omission of the cobalt addition, cobalt washed-out at a stable rate of 0.1 $\mu$g{\textperiodcentered}g VSS−1{\textperiodcentered}d−1.

It operated as a single-phase reactor under both the cheese whey and dairy manure feeding conditions when the pH was not controlled (similar pH values in the inlet and outlet chambers) and as a two-stage, two-phase reactor when the pH of the whey was controlled in the methanogenic stage (different pH values in the inlet and outlet chambers). The results indicated that production of biogas from cheese whey without pH control is not feasible as the digester experienced acid-phase digestion in both stages. However, controlling the pH of the methanogenic stage increased the biogas production rate and methane yield, as well as the reductions in COD and solids concentrations of the cheese whey by a factor of 2.7-3.0. Although the pH was maintained at 5.7-6.0, the results are comparable to those obtained with dairy manure of a similar solids concentration and a pH of 7 ± 0.2. A further increase in the pH (to 7.0 ± 0.2) would, therefore, increase the biogas production rate and methane yield from cheese whey.},

abstract = {Freshwater sediment microbial communities enriched by growth on vegetable oil in the presence of a substoichiometric amount of ferric hydroxide (sufficient to accept about 12{\%} of the vegetable-oil-derived electrons) degrade vegetable oil to methane faster than similar microbial communities that develop when sediments are enriched by growth on vegetable oil in the absence of ferric hydroxide. This study examined the effects of enrichment in the presence of Fe(III) on the fatty-acid sensitivity of several important members of anaerobic triglyceride-degrading microbial communities in freshwater sediments. The fatty-acid sensitivity of three groups of microorganisms--hydrogenotrophic methanogens, acetate consumers, and hydrogen-producing acetogens--were investigated by comparing the rates of hydrogen, acetate, or butyrate consumption in the presence and absence of oleic acid. Methanogenesis from hydrogen was not affected by sediment enrichment conditions or by the presence of oleic acid, suggesting that hydrogenotrophic methanogens were insensitive to fatty acid inhibition in these sediments. Oleic acid inhibited the anaerobic degradation rates of acetate and butyrate by 38{\%} and 63{\%}, respectively, but enrichment in the presence of Fe(III) eliminated the fatty-acid sensitivity of acetate degradation and reduced the sensitivity of butyrate degradation by about half. These results suggest that iron-reducing bacteria may provide an alternative pathway through which vegetable oil can be converted to methane in anaerobic freshwater sediments.},

abstract = {The microbial interactions occurring in an anaerobic hybrid reactor which was seeded with non-sulphate-adapted sludge and subsequently exposed to sulphate over a prolonged period of 423 days were studied. The population changes upon inoculation of the reactor with sulphate-adapted sludge from a full-scale treatment plant were also analysed. Addition of sulphate (4000 mg/l) to the reactor influent resulted in a complete inhibition of syntrophic propionate degradation and severe inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis. No propionate or acetate-utilising sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) could be detected in the sulphate-fed reactor sludge. Toxicity tests carried out on sludge samples from a control reactor showed that acetoclastic methanogenesis was the most sensitive step in sulphide inhibition, with 50{\%} inhibition observed at concentrations of 220-980 mg total sulphide/l (69-150 mg free H2S/l) over the pH range 6.5-8.0. The propionate-utilising syntrophs present in the sludge appeared to be irreversibly inhibited by sulphide and were also inhibited by acetate concentrations as low as 300 mg/l. The inoculation of full-scale sulphate-adapted sludge resulted in the establishment of propionate and hydrogen-utilising SRB in the biofilm section, but not in the granular sludge bed section, of the anaerobic hybrid reactor.},

abstract = {The effects of temperature on rates and pathways of CH4 production and on the abundance and structure of the archaeal community were investigated in acidic peat from a mire in northern Scandinavia (68°N). We monitored the production of CH4 and CO2 over time and measured the turnover of Fe(II), ethanol, and organic acids. All experiments were performed with and without specific inhibitors (2-bromoethanesulfonate [BES] for methanogenesis and CH3F for acetoclastic methanogenesis). The optimum temperature for methanogenesis was 25°C (2.3  mol CH4 {\textperiodcentered} g [dry weight] 1 {\textperiodcentered} day 1), but the activity was relatively high even at 4°C (0.25  mol CH4 {\textperiodcentered} g [dry weight] 1 {\textperiodcentered} day 1). The theoretical lower limit for methanogenesis was calculated to be at  5°C. The optimum temperature for growth as revealed by real-time PCR was 25°C for both archaea and bacteria. The population structure of archaea was studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and remained constant over a wide temperature range. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis accounted for about 80{\%} of the total methanogenesis. Most 16S rRNA gene sequences that were affiliated with methanogens and all McrA sequences clustered with the exclusively hydrogenotrophic order Methanobacteriales, correlating with the prevalence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Fe reduction occurred parallel to methanogenesis and was inhibited by BES, suggesting that methanogens were involved in Fe reduction. Based upon the observed balance of substrates and thermodynamic calculations, we concluded that the ethanol pool was oxidized to acetate by the following two processes: syntrophic oxidation with methanogenesis (i) as an H2 sink and (ii) as a reductant for Fe(III). Acetate accumulated, but a considerable fraction was converted to butyrate, making volatile fatty acids important end products of anaerobic metabolism.},

abstract = {We continuously fed an anaerobic chemostat with synthetic wastewater containing glucose as the sole source of carbon and energy to study the effects of temperature on the microbial community under hyperthermophilic (65-80 degrees C) conditions. Methane was produced normally up to 77.5 degrees C at a dilution rate of 0.025 d(-1). However, the concentration of microorganisms and the rate of gas production decreased with increasing operation temperature. The microbial community in the chemostat at various temperatures was analyzed based on the 16S rRNA gene using molecular biological techniques including clone library analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Aceticlastic methanogens related to Methanosarcina thermophila were detected at 65 degrees C and hydrogenotrophilic methanogens related to Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus were the dominant methanogens between 70 degrees C to 77.5 degrees C. Bacteria related to Clostridium stercorarium and Thermoanaerobacter subterraneus comprised the dominant glucose-fermenting bacteria at temperatures of 65 degrees C and above, respectively. Bacteria related to Thermacetogenium phaeum and to Tepidiphilus margaritifer and Petrobacter succinatimandens were the dominant acetate-oxidizing bacteria at 70 degrees C and at 75-77.5 degrees C, respectively. The results suggested that, at temperatures of 70 degrees C and above, methane production via the aceticlastic pathway was negligible and indirect methanogenesis from acetate was dominant. Since acetate oxidation is a rate limiting step and a higher temperature favors the hydrolysis and acid formation, a two stage fermentation process, acidogenic and methanogenic fermentation stages operated under different temperatures, should be more suitable for the thermophilic anaerobic treatment at temperatures above 65 degrees C.},

However, little is known about isotopic discrimination during acetoclastic CH(4) production. Therefore, we studied two species of the Methanosarcinaceae family, Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanosarcina acetivorans, and a methanogenic rice field soil amended with acetate. The values of the isotope enrichment factor (epsilon) associated with consumption of total acetate (epsilon(ac)), consumption of acetate-methyl (epsilon(ac-methyl)) and production of CH(4) (epsilon(CH4)) were an epsilon(ac) of -30.5 per thousand, an epsilon(ac-methyl) of -25.6 per thousand, and an epsilon(CH4) of -27.4 per thousand for M. barkeri and an epsilon(ac) of -35.3 per thousand, an epsilon(ac-methyl) of -24.8 per thousand, and an epsilon(CH4) of -23.8 per thousand for M. acetivorans. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of archaeal 16S rRNA genes indicated that acetoclastic methanogenic populations in rice field soil were dominated by Methanosarcina spp. Isotope fractionation determined during acetoclastic methanogenesis in rice field soil resulted in an epsilon(ac) of -18.7 per thousand, an epsilon(ac-methyl) of -16.9 per thousand, and an epsilon(CH4) of -20.8 per thousand. However, in rice field soil as well as in the pure cultures, values of epsilon(ac) and epsilon(ac-methyl) decreased as acetate concentrations decreased, eventually approaching zero. Thus, isotope fractionation of acetate carbon was apparently affected by substrate concentration. The epsilon values determined in pure cultures were consistent with those in rice field soil if the concentration of acetate was taken into account.},

The nickel content of the sludge decreased by 66{\%} during the 261-day reactor run because of washout and doubling of the sludge bed volume. Nickel deprivation initially had a strong impact on the methanogenic activity of the sludge with methanol; e.g., after 89 days of operation, this activity was doubled by adding 2 $\mu$M nickel. Upon prolonged UASB reactor operation, methanol and VFA effluent concentrations decreased whereas the sludge lost its response to nickel addition in activity tests. This suggests that a less nickel-dependent methanol-converting sludge had developed in the UASB reactor.},

abstract = {A study of the effect of the organic loading rate (OLR) on the anaerobic acidogenic fermentation of two-phase olive mill solid residue (OMSR) derived from fruits with a low ripening index was carried out in a laboratory-scale completely stirred tank reactor at mesophilic temperature (35 degrees C). Eight experimental runs were carried out at OLRs of 3.2, 5.6, 7.4, 9.6, 11.0, 12.9, 14.0 and 15.1g T-COD/ld, which were equivalent to hydraulic retention times of 50.0, 28.8, 21.8, 16.9, 14.7, 12.4, 11.5 and 10.7d, respectively. The experimental results obtained demonstrated that the optimum value of OLR for the acidogenic fermentation process was 12.9 g T-COD/ld, for which a maximum production of acetic acid was achieved. It was found that inhibition of the process occurred at OLRs higher than 12.9 g T-COD/ld. This was characterized by a significant decrease in the acetic acid concentration in the effluent and an increase in the concentration of other volatile acids that may affect the methanogenic step. The process inhibition was also characterized by the plateau in the curves of the effluent substrate concentration versus the OLR applied. It was found that a first-order kinetics satisfactorily described the influence of non-acetic acid soluble organic matter concentration (S-COD( *)) on the rate of soluble organic matter conversion to acetic acid (R(S-COD)( *)), and the influence of acetic acid concentration (AcH) on the rate of acetic acid production (R(AcH)), while a potential equation type adequately described the influence of acetic acid concentration on the volumetric hydrogen production (R(ACH) ). The kinetic constant for soluble organic matter removal was 0.145 d(-1), while the constant for acetic acid formation was found to be 0.075 d(-1).},

abstract = {The overall performance of a two-phase anaerobic wastewater treatment system was determined as a function of the extent of recycle of the effluent from the methanogenic reactor to the acidification reactor. The system consisted of a well mixed continuous reactor as the acidification stage, which was controlled at pH 6 by automatic addition of caustic soda, and a fluidized sand bed reactor for the methanogenic stage, which was left uncontrolled. The results showed that the introduction of recycle could minimize the total operational costs of treatment due mainly to a considerable saving in alkali addition. The results confirmed earlier model predictions. The introduction of recycle acidified the methanogenic reactor, thereby removing dissolved carbon dioxide to the gas phase; this reduction in the concentration of weak acids was the principal cause of the decrease in the caustic consumption. The effects of the recycle rate on other operating variables such as effluent pH and COD, biomass loss and methane content of the exit gas were also assessed.},

Diethyl ether was used to facilitate precise addition of LCFAs and provide adequate dispersion in cultures. Butyrate degradation was affected by diethyl ether but minimal effects were observed on hydrogen and glucose consumption. In the presence of oleic and stearic acids, the glucose consumption rate was similar but was {\~{}}50{\%} lower in the presence of linoleic acid. The effect of a mixture of 100 mg l-1 of each individual LCFA (300 mg l-1 total LCFA) was approximately the same as 100 mg l-1 linoleic acid alone, suggesting no synergistic inhibition of glucose degradation. Butyric acid degradation was more severely inhibited by the LCFAs with inhibition becoming more severe with the addition of double bonds to the LCFA. Furthermore, mixtures of LCFAs synergistically inhibited butyric acid degradation compared to the results with individual LCFAs. In contrast, although lower hydrogen consumption rates were observed in cultures receiving oleic and linoleic acids compared to cultures receiving stearic acid, inhibition by all three acids individually or in mixture was limited. The introduction of LCFAs into a system may severly inhibit intermediate acid degradation while having little effect on acid production.},

abstract = {The effects of acetate, propionate, and butyrate on the anaerobic thermophilic conversion of propionate by methanogenic sludge and by enriched propionate-oxidizing bacteria in syntrophy with Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum AH were studied. The methanogenic sludge was cultivated in an upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor fed with propionate (35 mM) as the sole substrate for a period of 80 days. Propionate degradation was shown to be severely inhibited by the addition of 50 mM acetate to the influent of the UASB reactor. The inhibitory effect remained even when the acetate concentration in the effluent was below the level of detection. Recovery of propionate oxidation occurred only when acetate was omitted from the influent medium. Propionate degradation by the methanogenic sludge in the UASB reactor was not affected by the addition of an equimolar concentration (35 mM) of butyrate to the influent. However, butyrate had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of the propionate-oxidizing enrichment culture. In that case, the conversion of propionate was almost completely inhibited at a butyrate concentration of 10 mM. However, addition of a butyrate-oxidizing enrichment culture abolished the inhibitory effect, and propionate oxidation was even stimulated. All experiments were conducted at pH 7.0 to 7.7. The thermophilic syntrophic culture showed a sensitivity to acetate and propionate similar to that of mesophilic cultures described in the literature. Additions of butyrate or acetate to the propionate medium had no effect on the hydrogen partial pressure in the biogas of an UASB reactor, nor was the hydrogen partial pressure in propionate-degrading cultures affected by the two acids. Our results indicate that the level of hydrogen in the biogas of thermophilic anaerobic reactors is not the appropriate control parameter for propionate degradation. High concentrations of NaCl, sodium acetate, or sodium propionate (100 mM) did not affect the growth of M. thermoautotrophicum AH on hydrogen.},

abstract = {The effect of tungsten (W) and molybdenum (Mo) on the growth of Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans and Methanospirillum hungatei was studied in syntrophic cultures and the pure cultures of both the organisms. Cells that were grown syntropically were separated by Percoll density centrifugation. Measurement of hydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase levels in cell extracts of syntrophically grown cells correlated with the methane formation rates in the co-cultures. The effect of W and Mo on the activity of formate dehydrogenase was considerable in both the organisms, whereas hydrogenase activity remained relatively constant. Depletion of tungsten and/or molybdenum, however, did not affect the growth of the pure culture of S. fumaroxidans on propionate plus fumarate significantly, although the specific activities of hydrogenase and especially formate dehydrogenase were influenced by the absence of Mo and W. This indicates that the organism has a low W or Mo requirement under these conditions. Growth of M. hungatei on either formate or H2/CO2 required tungsten, and molybdenum could replace tungsten to some extent. Our results suggest a more prominent role for H2 as electron carrier in the syntrophic conversion of propionate, when the essential trace metals W and Mo for the functioning of formate dehydrogenase are depleted.},

abstract = {Acetate conversion pathways of methanogenic consortia in acetate-fed chemostats at dilution rates of 0.025 and 0.6 day(-1) were investigated by using (13)C-labeled acetates, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the CH(4) and CO(2) produced. Nonaceticlastic syntrophic oxidation by acetate-oxidizing syntrophs and hydrogenotrophic methanogens was suggested to occupy a primary pathway (approximately 62 to 90{\%}) in total methanogenesis at the low dilution rate. In contrast, aceticlastic cleavage of acetate by aceticlastic methanogens was suggested to occupy a primary pathway (approximately 95 to 99{\%}) in total methanogenesis at the high dilution rate. Phylogenetic analyses of transcripts of the methyl coenzyme M reductase gene (mcrA) confirmed that a significant number of transcripts of the genera Methanoculleus (hydrogenotrophic methanogens) and Methanosarcina (aceticlastic methanogens) were present in the chemostats at the low and high dilution rates, respectively. The mcrA transcripts of the genus Methanosaeta (aceticlastic methanogens), which dominated the population in a previous study (T. Shigematsu, Y. Tang, H. Kawaguchi, K. Ninomiya, J. Kijima, T. Kobayashi, S. Morimura, and K. Kida, J. Biosci. Bioeng. 96:547-558, 2003), were poorly detected at both dilution rates due to the limited coverage of the primers used. These results demonstrated that the dilution rate could cause a shift in the primary pathway of acetate conversion to methane in acetate-fed chemostats.},

The methanogenic activity from methanol was dramatically stimulated by the addition of a cocktail of trace elements in the basal medium. When trace elements were supplied individually, cobalt greatly stimulated methanogenesis which equalled the stimulation observed with the complete trace element mixture. No remarkable influence of any trace element was observed when acetate was used as the substrate. Two Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactors were operated with and without supplementation of cobalt. Cobalt greatly stimulated both acetogenesis in the initial operational phase and later methanogenesis. The cobalt sufficient column provided almost 3 times the methane productivity compared to the cobalt deprived column. At an organic loading rate of 8 g COD/l{\textperiodcentered}d, 87{\%} of the COD was converted to methane in the cobalt sufficient column. Under low cobalt concentration, methanogens compete better for cobalt than acetogens.},

We employed a multidisciplinary approach that combined culture-dependent and -independent analyses with geochemical measurements in the sediments of Skan Bay, Alaska (53 degrees N, 167 degrees W), to investigate methanogenesis there. Cultivation-independent analyses of the archaeal community revealed that uncultivated microbes of the kingdoms Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota are present at Skan Bay and that methanogens constituted a small proportion of the archaeal community. Methanogens were cultivated from depths of 0 to 60 cm in the sediments, and several strains related to the orders Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales were isolated. Isolates were psychrotolerant marine-adapted strains and included an aceticlastic methanogen, strain AK-6, as well as three strains of CO(2)-reducing methanogens: AK-3, AK7, and AK-8. The phylogenetic positions and physiological characteristics of these strains are described. We propose a new species, Methanogenium boonei, with strain AK-7 as the type strain.},

Sekiguchi, H. Takahashi, Y. Kamagata, A. Ohashi, and H. Harada, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 67:5740-5749, 2001). To further elucidate the ecology and function of Anaerolinea-type filamentous microbes in UASB sludge granules, we surveyed the diversity, distribution, and physiological properties of Chloroflexi subphylum I microbes residing in UASB granules. Five different types of mesophilic and thermophilic UASB sludge were used to analyze the Chloroflexi subphylum I populations. 16S rRNA gene cloning-based analyses using a 16S rRNA gene-targeted Chloroflexi-specific PCR primer set revealed that all clonal sequences were affiliated with the Chloroflexi subphylum I group and that a number of different phylotypes were present in each clone library, suggesting the ubiquity and vast genetic diversity of these populations in UASB sludge granules. Subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the three different types of mesophilic sludge granules using a Chloroflexi-specific probe suggested that all probe-reactive cells had a filamentous morphology and were widely distributed within the sludge granules. The FISH observations also indicated that the Chloroflexi subphylum I bacteria were not always the predominant populations within mesophilic sludge granules, in contrast to thermophilic sludge granules. We isolated two mesophilic strains and one thermophilic strain belonging to the Chloroflexi subphylum I group. The physiological properties of these isolates suggested that these populations may contribute to the degradation of carbohydrates and other cellular components, such as amino acids, in the bioreactors.},

abstract = {A dual approach consisting of cultivation and molecular retrieval of partial archaeal 16S rRNA genes was carried out to characterize the diversity and structure of the methanogenic community inhabiting the anoxic bulk soil of flooded rice microcosms. The molecular approach identified four groups of known methanogens. Three environmental sequences clustered with Methanobacterium bryantii and Methanobacterium formicicum, six were closely related but not identical to those of strains of Methanosaeta concilii, two grouped with members of the genus Methanosarcina, and two were related to the methanogenic endosymbiont of Plagiopyla nasuta. The cultivation approach via most-probable-number counts with a subsample of the same soil as an inoculum yielded cell numbers of up to 10(7) per g of dry soil for the H2-CO2-utilizing methanogens and of up to 10(6) for the acetate-utilizing methanogens. Strain VeH52, isolated from the terminal positive dilution on H2-CO2, grouped within the phylogenetic radiation characterized by M. bryantii and M. formicicum and the environmental sequences of the Methanobacterium-like group. A consortium of two distinct methanogens grew in the terminal positive culture on acetate. These two organisms showed absolute 16S rRNA gene identities with environmental sequences of the novel Methanosaeta-like group and the Methanobacterium-like group. Methanosarcina spp. were identified only in the less-dilute levels of the same dilution series on acetate. These data correlate well with acetate concentrations of about 11 microM in the pore water of this rice paddy soil. These concentrations are too low for the growth of known Methanosarcina spp. but are at the acetate utilization threshold of Methanosaeta spp. Thus, our data indicated Methanosaeta spp. and Methanobacterium spp. to be the dominant methanogenic groups in the anoxic rice soil, whereas Methanosarcina spp. appeared to be less abundant.},

abstract = {The influence of ammonia on the anaerobic degradation of peptone by mesophilic and thermophilic populations of biowaste was investigated. For peptone concentrations from 5 g l−1 to 20 g l−1 the mesophilic population revealed a higher rate of deamination than the thermophilic population, e.g. 552 mg l−1 day−1 compared to 320 mg l−1 day−1 at 10 g l−1 peptone. The final degree of deamination of the thermophilic population was, however, higher: 102 compared to 87 mg NH3/g peptone in the mesophilic cultures. If 0.5–6.5 g l−1 ammonia was added to the mesophilic biowaste cultures, deamination of peptone, degradation of its chemical oxygen demand (COD) and formation of biogas were increasingly inhibited, but no hydrogen was formed. The thermophilic biowaste cultures were most active if around 1 g ammonia l−1 was present. Deamination, COD degradation and biogas production decreased at lower and higher ammonia concentrations and hydrogen was formed in addition to methane. Studies of the inhibition by ammonia of peptone deamination, COD degradation and methane formation revealed a K i (50{\%}) for NH3 of 92, 95 and 88 mg l−1 at 37 °C and 251, 274 and 297 mg l−1 at 55 °C respectively. This indicated that the thermophilic flora tolerated significantly more NH3 than the mesophilic flora. In the mesophilic reactor effluent 4.6 × 108 peptone-degrading colony-forming units (cfu)/ml were culturable, whereas in the thermophilic reactor effluent growth of only 5.6 × 107 cfu/ml was observed.},

abstract = {Methanogenesis in cold marine sediments is a globally important process leading to methane hydrate deposits, cold seeps, physical instability of sediment, and atmospheric methane emissions. We employed a multidisciplinary approach that combined culture-dependent and -independent analyses with geochemical measurements in the sediments of Skan Bay, Alaska (53 degrees N, 167 degrees W), to investigate methanogenesis there. Cultivation-independent analyses of the archaeal community revealed that uncultivated microbes of the kingdoms Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota are present at Skan Bay and that methanogens constituted a small proportion of the archaeal community. Methanogens were cultivated from depths of 0 to 60 cm in the sediments, and several strains related to the orders Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales were isolated. Isolates were psychrotolerant marine-adapted strains and included an aceticlastic methanogen, strain AK-6, as well as three strains of CO(2)-reducing methanogens: AK-3, AK7, and AK-8. The phylogenetic positions and physiological characteristics of these strains are described. We propose a new species, Methanogenium boonei, with strain AK-7 as the type strain.},

abstract = {Marine bacterioplanktons are thought to play a vital role in Southern Ocean ecology and ecosystem function, as they do in other ocean systems. However, our understanding of phylogenetic diversity, genome-enabled capabilities and specific adaptations to this persistently cold environment is limited. Bacterioplankton community composition shifts significantly over the annual cycle as sea ice melts and phytoplankton bloom. Microbial diversity in sea ice is better known than that of the plankton, where culture collections do not appear to represent organisms detected with molecular surveys. Broad phylogenetic groupings of Antarctic bacterioplankton such as the marine group I Crenarchaeota, alpha-Proteobacteria (Roseobacter-related and SAR-11 clusters), gamma-Proteobacteria (both cultivated and uncultivated groups) and Bacteriodetes-affiliated organisms in Southern Ocean waters are in common with other ocean systems. Antarctic SSU rRNA gene phylotypes are typically affiliated with other polar sequences. Some species such as Polaribacter irgensii and currently uncultivated gamma-Proteobacteria (Ant4D3 and Ant10A4) may flourish in Antarctic waters, though further studies are needed to address diversity on a larger scale. Insights from initial genomics studies on both cultivated organisms and genomes accessed through shotgun cloning of environmental samples suggest that there are many unique features of these organisms that facilitate survival in high-latitude, persistently cold environments.},

abstract = {The effect of dosing a metal limited anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor with a metal pulse on the methanogenic activity of granular sludge has thus far not been successfully modeled. The prediction of this effect is crucial in order to optimize the strategy for metal dosage and to prevent unnecessary losses of resources. This paper describes the relation between the initial immobilization of cobalt in anaerobic granular sludge cobalt dosage into the reactor and the evolution of methanogenic activity during the subsequent weeks. An operationally defined parameter (A0{\textperiodcentered}B0) was found to combine the amount of cobalt immobilized instantaneously upon the pulse (B0) and the amount of cobalt immobilized within the subsequent 24 h (A0). In contrast with the individual parameters A0 and B0, the parameter A0{\textperiodcentered}B0 correlated significantly with the methanogenic activity of the sludge during the subsequent 16 or 35 days. This correlation between metal retention and activity evolution is a useful tool to implement trace metal dosing strategies for biofilm-based biotechnological processes.},

abstract = {The expression of genes involved in methanogenesis in a thermophilic hydrogen-utilizing methanogen, Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus strain TM, was investigated both in a pure culture sufficiently supplied with H(2) plus CO(2) and in a coculture with an acetate-oxidizing hydrogen-producing bacterium, Thermacetogenium phaeum strain PB, in which hydrogen partial pressure was constantly kept very low (20 to 80 Pa). Northern blot analysis indicated that only the mcr gene, which encodes methyl coenzyme M reductase I (MRI), catalyzing the final step of methanogenesis, was expressed in the coculture, whereas mcr and mrt, which encodes methyl coenzyme M reductase II (MRII), the isofunctional enzyme of MRI, were expressed at the early to late stage of growth in the pure culture. In contrast to these two genes, two isofunctional genes (mtd and mth) for N(5),N(10)-methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the fourth step of methanogenesis, and two hydrogenase genes (frh and mvh) were expressed both in a pure culture and in a coculture at the early and late stages of growth. The same expression pattern was observed for Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus strain DeltaH cocultured with a thermophilic butyrate-oxidizing syntroph, Syntrophothermus lipocalidus strain TGB-C1. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole proteins of M. thermoautotrophicus strain TM obtained from a pure culture and a coculture with the acetate-oxidizing syntroph and subsequent N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis confirmed that MRI and MRII were produced in the pure culture, while only MRI was produced in the coculture. These results indicate that under syntrophic growth conditions, the methanogen preferentially utilizes MRI but not MRII. Considering that hydrogenotrophic methanogens are strictly dependent for growth on hydrogen-producing fermentative microbes in the natural environment and that the hydrogen supply occurs constantly at very low concentrations compared with the supply in pure cultures in the laboratory, the results suggest that MRI is an enzyme primarily functioning in natural methanogenic ecosystems.},

These new oligonucleotide probes facilitated the identification, localization, and quantification of the specific relative abundance of M. concilii and Methanosarcina barkeri, which play important roles in methanogenesis. The combined use of fluorescent in situ hybridization with confocal scanning laser microscopy demonstrated that anaerobic granule topography depends on granule origin and feeding. Protein-fed granules showed no layered structure with a random distribution of M. concilii. In contrast, a layered structure developed in methanol-enriched granules, where M. barkeri growth was induced in an outer layer. This outer layer was followed by a layer composed of M. concilii, with an inner core of M. concilii and other bacteria.},

abstract = {The design and evaluation of a set of universal primers and probe for the amplification of 16S rDNA from the Domain Bacteria to estimate total bacterial load by real-time PCR is reported. Broad specificity of the universal detection system was confirmed by testing DNA isolated from 34 bacterial species encompassing most of the groups of bacteria outlined in Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology. However, the nature of the chromosomal DNA used as a standard was critical. A DNA standard representing those bacteria most likely to predominate in a given habitat was important for a more accurate determination of total bacterial load due to variations in 16S rDNA copy number and the effect of generation time of the bacteria on this number, since rapid growth could result in multiple replication forks and hence, in effect, more than one copy of portions of the chromosome. The validity of applying these caveats to estimating bacterial load was confirmed by enumerating the number of bacteria in an artificial sample mixed in vitro and in clinical carious dentine samples. Taking these parameters into account, the number of anaerobic bacteria estimated by the universal probe and primers set in carious dentine was 40-fold greater than the total bacterial load detected by culture methods, demonstrating the utility of real-time PCR in the analysis of this environment.},

Several experimental runs were conducted to validate and optimise the technique. The results showed that the technique is reliable, workable and reproducible.},

abstract = {A denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method for analyzing 16S rDNA of methanogenic archaeal community in paddy field soil is presented. Five specific primers for 16S rDNA of methanogenic archaea, which were modified from the primers for archaea, were first evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and DGGE using genomic DNAs of 13 pure culture strains of methanogenic archaea. The DGGE analysis was possible with two primer pairs (0348aF-GC and 0691R; 0357F-GC and 0691R) of the five pairs tested although 16S rDNA of some non-methanogenic archaea was amplified with 0348aF-GC and 0691R. These two primer pairs were further evaluated for use in analysis of methanogenic archaeal community in Japanese paddy field soil. Good separation and quality of patterns were obtained in DGGE analysis with both primer pairs. A total of 41 DNA fragments were excised from the DGGE gels and their sequences were determined. All fragments belonged to methanogenic archaea. These results indicate that the procedure of DGGE analysis with the primer pair 0357F-GC and 0691R is suitable for investigating methanogenic archaeal community in paddy field soil.},

The development and distribution of microorganisms, which firmly and loosely attached to solid materials, and presented in the leachate in the LB reactors, were investigated by 16S rRNA gene-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and clone library analyses. The phylotypes and their relative abundance changed in the respective bacterial community throughout the 49-day run and showed differences between the communities. Large numbers of phylotypes were detected from day 10 onwards. On day 17, the majority of phylotypes in the bacterial community firmly attached to solid residues affiliated to the classes Clostridia and Bacteroidetes. There were high numbers of the phylotypes in the leachate bacterial community. They were closely related to members of classes Clostridia, Bacteroidetes, Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and OP10. The Clostridium-like species clearly dominated the bacterial community. Archaea were only found in the solid residues on day 17 and in the leachate on days 10 and 17. The majority of the Archaea fell within the hydrogenotrophic genus Methanobacterium. The organism assigned to the aceticlastic genus Methanosarcina was only present in the solid residues.},

Epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI (4',6-diamidine-2-phenylindole) as fluorochrome was used to determine the total number of micro-organisms in the reactors, and autofluorescence microscopy for the number of the autofluroescent methanogenic populations. The results obtained by the direct count methods were compared to the quantity of biomass contained in the system, determined by volatile suspended solids. The viable bacterial population was determined by plating techniques using an anaerobic chamber. The total bacterial and F420 autofluorescent populations of single-stage digesters increase when the hydraulic retention time decreases; nevertheless, the percentages of the autofluorescent methanogens remain constant at 13{\%}. In the two-stage reactors, the percentages of this group are 99{\%} and 26{\%} of the total population in the acidogenic and methanogenic factors, respectively. In the single-stage reactors, biomass determinations can be used to estimate microbial concentrations, and vice versa, as there is a high positive correlation between microorganism concentration and biomass. It was obtained a high correlation between direct counts by epifluorescence microscopy and viable plate counts for the combined system studied.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The activated sludge process is one of the most widely used methods for treatment of wastewater and the microbial community composition in the sludge is important for the process operation. While the bacterial communities have been characterized in various activated sludge systems little is known about archaeal communities in activated sludge. The diversity and dynamics of the Archaea community in a full-scale activated sludge wastewater treatment plant were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: The Archaea community was specialized and dominated by Methanosaeta-like species. During a 15 month period major changes in the community composition were only observed twice despite seasonal variations in environmental and operating conditions. Water temperature appeared to be the process parameter that affected the community composition the most. Several terminal restriction fragments also showed strong correlations with sludge properties and effluent water properties. The Archaea were estimated to make up 1.6-{\%} of total cell numbers in the activated sludge and were present both as single cells and colonies of varying sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here show that Archaea can constitute a constant and integral part of the activated sludge and that it can therefore be useful to include Archaea in future studies of microbial communities in activated sludge.},

abstract = {Waste and wastewater treatment processes produce odours, which can cause a nuisance to adjacent populations and contribute significantly to atmospheric pollution. Sulphurous compounds are responsible for acid rain and mist; many organic compounds of industrial origin contribute to airborne public health concerns, as well as environmental problems. Waste gases from industry have traditionally been treated using physicochemical processes, such as scrubbing, adsorption, condensation, and oxidation, however, biological treatment of waste gases has gained support as an effective and economical option in the past few decades. One emergent technique for biological waste gas treatment is the use of existing activated sludge plants as bioscrubbers, thus treating the foul air generated by other process units of the wastewater treatment system on site, with no requirement for additional units or for interruption of wastewater treatment. Limited data are available regarding the performance of activated sludge diffusion of odorous air in spite of numerous positive reports from full-scale applications in North America. This review argues that the information available is insufficient for precise process design and optimization, and simultaneous activated sludge treatment of wastewater and airborne odours could be adopted worldwide.},

abstract = {Control of sulfate reduction by adding molybdate was investigated to enhance the methane production under batch and continuous operation in the anaerobic digestion of a sulfate-rich lysine wastewater. In phase 1 of the continuous operation, four anaerobic filters were fed with the lysine wastewater and then added with molybdate at 1,3,5 and 10 mM just after methane producing bacteria (MPB) were completely inhibited by H2S produced by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). In phase 2, three anaerobic filters were operated with continuous or intermittent addition of 3 mM molybdate from the beginning of operation, including one with no molybdate as a control. Batch experiments revealed that the sulfate reduction was strongly inhibited and finally ceased by adding 3 mM or more of molybdate, resulting in great enhancement of the methane production. In phase 1 of the continuous experiments, all reactors showed the cessation of the methane production when the content of H2S reached 9-10 {\%} in biogas, but the MPB activity was gradually recovered after initiating the molybdate addition at 3 or 5 mM. The 10 mM dosage of molybdate, however, had an inhibiting effect to MPB as well as SRB, resulting in the accumulation of acetate within the reactor. In phase 2, the control reactor continued to decrease the methane production, and a methane conversion rate was only 3{\%} in the control, while 35 and 10{\%} in continuously-added and intermittently-added reactors, respectively. Thus, it was confirmed that the MPB activity was greatly enhanced under control of the SRB activity by the continuous addition of molybdate. Comparing phase 2 with phase 1, addition from the start-up of the process is considered more effective than addition after the methane production dropped in the control of the sulfate reduction by molybdate.},

The compositions of acetate, propionate and butyrate used as substrate were 25:35:40. The tests were performed at constant temperature (55°C) and pH 7 on two duplicate batch reactors (I and II) running in parallel and were repeated to show the effect of acclimatization. During the first feeding, there was a significant lag phase and after about 23 h incubation the volumes of CH4 gases produced from two reactors were only about 20 and 490 ml, respectively. In this experiment, propionate was converted to acetate only after the initial concentrations of butyrate and acetate had completely degraded. Acetate formed from propionate was immediately converted to methane and carbon dioxide. The maximum methanogenic activities of the first feeding were not high because the natural populations of the propionate-degrading bacteria were low and the sludge adapted itself to the VFAs' substrate very slowly. In a second experiment with the same sludge, the maximum methanogenic activities of the second feedings were about 1.60 times higher than those of the first feedings because of the adaptation of the sludge and increase of populations of the propionate-degrading bacteria.},

abstract = {In a lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor inoculated with granular sludge from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant treating paper mill wastewater, methanethiol (MT) was degraded at 30 degrees C to H2S, CO2, and CH4. At a hydraulic retention time of 9 h, a maximum influent concentration of 6 mM MT was applied, corresponding to a volumetric loading rate of 16.5 mmol liter-1 day-1. The archaeal community within the reactor was characterized by anaerobic culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis, cloning, and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and quantitative PCR. Initially, MT-fermenting methanogenic archaea related to members of the genus Methanolobus were enriched in the reactor. Later, they were outcompeted by Methanomethylovorans hollandica, which was detected in aggregates but not inside the granules that originated from the inoculum, the microbial composition of which remained fairly unchanged. Possibly other species within the Methanosarcinacaea also contributed to the fermentation of MT, but they were not enriched by serial dilution in liquid media. The archaeal community within the granules, which was dominated by Methanobacterium beijingense, did not change substantially during the reactor operation. Some of the species related to Methanomethylovorans hollandica were enriched by serial dilutions, but their growth rates were very low. Interestingly, the enrichments could be sustained only in the presence of MT and did not utilize any of the other typical substrates for methylotrophic methanogens, such as methanol, methyl amine, or dimethylsulfide.},

abstract = {These experiments were performed to determine the degradation of VFA (acetate, propionate and butyrate) and the maximum methanogenic activity of granular sludge from the thermophilic anaerobic digestion of pure molasses. The compositions of acetate, propionate and butyrate used as substrate were 25:35:40. The tests were performed at constant temperature (55°C) and pH 7 on two duplicate batch reactors (I and II) running in parallel and were repeated to show the effect of acclimatization. During the first feeding, there was a significant lag phase and after about 23 h incubation the volumes of CH4 gases produced from two reactors were only about 20 and 490 ml, respectively. In this experiment, propionate was converted to acetate only after the initial concentrations of butyrate and acetate had completely degraded. Acetate formed from propionate was immediately converted to methane and carbon dioxide. The maximum methanogenic activities of the first feeding were not high because the natural populations of the propionate-degrading bacteria were low and the sludge adapted itself to the VFAs' substrate very slowly. In a second experiment with the same sludge, the maximum methanogenic activities of the second feedings were about 1.60 times higher than those of the first feedings because of the adaptation of the sludge and increase of populations of the propionate-degrading bacteria.},

Primers designed for use in TaqMan real-time PCR for the organisms Methanosaeta, Methanosarcina, and Methanoculleus have been described previously; however, we found that (i) the Methanoculleus primers were not specific to members of the genus and that (ii) the Methanosarcina primers did not work specifically with SYBR Green real-time PCR. Thus, we designed new primers for these and other methanogens, and we optimized SYBR Green real-time PCR assays. Primers were tested by end-point and real-time PCR, and they were found to work specifically and sensitively. Application of these primers will allow the detection and quantification of Methanoculleus, Methanosarcina, Methanothermobacter, and a group of yet uncultured archaea from anaerobic habitats.},

Oligonucleotide probes were designed based on sequence differences in the 16S rRNA genes in order to target microorganisms in situ. For microarray hybridisations, DNA was subjected to PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene and Cy5-labeled. The microarray was tested with pure cultures, and of the 1854 individual probe-target hybridisation reactions performed, there were only 28 false positive (1.5{\%}) and 16 false negative signals (0.86{\%}). The sensitivity of the array was also tested, and it was found that when 0.4pg of DNA from a pure culture was subjected to PCR amplification, signals above the detection limit were obtained. Also, the application of 25ng of PCR product from a pure culture to an array resulted in detectable signals. The ANAEROCHIP was hybridised with DNA from an anaerobic sludge. Strong hybridisation signals were obtained for Methanoculleus, and weaker signals, in decreasing order, were obtained for Methanosarcina, Methanobacterium, Methanobrevibacter, and Methanosphaera. In order to check the results obtained with the microarray, the archaeal community structure of the same digester was analysed by 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing. Community structure was determined by restriction digestion of almost 200 clones and by sequencing of the 15 different resulting patterns. Methanoculleus was the dominant (84.1{\%}) microorganism in the anaerobic sludge, and Methanobrevibacter (5.8{\%}), Methanobacterium (3.7{\%}), Methanosarcina (2.1{\%}), Methanosphaera (1.6{\%}), an uncultured archaeon (1.6{\%}) and Methanothermobacter (1{\%}) were also detected.

abstract = {The thermophilic, anaerobic, propionate-oxidizing bacterial populations present in the methanogenic granular sludge in a thermophilic (55°C) upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor were studied by cultivation and in situ hybridization analysis. For isolation of propionate-degrading microbes, primary enrichment was made with propionate as the sole energy source at 55°C. After several attempts to purify the microbes, a thermophilic, syntrophic, propionate-oxidizing bacterium, designated strain SI, was isolated in both pure culture and coculture with Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. Under thermophilic (55°C) conditions, strain SI oxidized propionate, ethanol, and lactate in coculture with M. thermoautotrophicum. In pure culture, the isolate was found to ferment pyruvate. 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis revealed that the strain was relatively close to members of the genus Desulfotomaculum, but it was only distantly related to any known species. To elucidate the abundance and spatial distribution of organisms of the strain SI type within the sludge granules, a 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe specific for strain SI was developed and applied to thin sections of the granules. Fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that a number of rod-shaped cells were present in the middle and inner layers of the thermophilic granule sections and that they formed close associations with hydrogenotrophic methanogens. They accounted for approximately 1.1{\%} of the total cells in the sludge. These results demonstrated that strain SI was one of the significant populations in the granular sludge and that it was responsible for propionate oxidation in the methanogenic granular sludge in the reactor.},

Digestion of particulate composites is described as a five-stage process involving disintegration, hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis, of which the last three process steps are represented by growth kinetics of the specific degrading biomass. Decay of the produced biomass according to ADM1 is depicted by a recycle mass flux to the composite particulate substrate.

Model calibration of separately monitored digestion of primary and secondary sludge (nitrogen content 0.030 g N/g TSS and 0.051 g N/g TSS, respectively) reveals the advantage of a clear distinction of disintegration and decay. The fate of nitrogen in the course of incorporation and release (0.016 g N/g TSS compared to 0.028 g N/g TSS) during digestion processes is comprehensible and the final ammonia concentration in the rejection water becomes predictable.},

For this purpose, the S-layer protein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus PV72/p2 was recombinantly expressed and used for coating positively charged liposomes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and hexadecylamine in a molar ratio of 10:5:4. Subsequently, plain (uncoated) liposomes and S-layer coated liposomes were silicified. Determination of the charge of the constructs during silicification allowed the deposition process to be followed. After the particles had been silicified, lipids were dissolved by treatment with Triton X-100 with the release of previously entrapped fluorescent dyes being determined by fluorimetry. Both, $\zeta$-potential and release experiments showed differences between silicified plain liposomes and silicified S-layer coated liposomes. The results of the individual preparation steps were examined by embedding the respective assemblies in resin, ultrathin sectioning and inspection by bright-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Energy filtered TEM confirmed the successful construction of S-layer based silica cages. It is anticipated that this approach will provide a key to enabling technology for the fabrication of nanoporous protein cages for applications ranging from nano medicine to materials science.},

abstract = {Control of sulfate reduction by adding molybdate was investigated to enhance the methane production under batch and continuous operation in the anaerobic digestion of a sulfate-rich lysine wastewater. In phase 1 of the continuous operation, four anaerobic filters were fed with the lysine wastewater and then added with molybdate at 1,3,5 and 10 mM just after methane producing bacteria (MPB) were completely inhibited by H2S produced by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). In phase 2, three anaerobic filters were operated with continuous or intermittent addition of 3 mM molybdate from the beginning of operation, including one with no molybdate as a control. Batch experiments revealed that the sulfate reduction was strongly inhibited and finally ceased by adding 3 mM or more of molybdate, resulting in great enhancement of the methane production. In phase 1 of the continuous experiments, all reactors showed the cessation of the methane production when the content of H2S reached 9-10 {\%} in biogas, but the MPB activity was gradually recovered after initiating the molybdate addition at 3 or 5 mM. The 10 mM dosage of molybdate, however, had an inhibiting effect to MPB as well as SRB, resulting in the accumulation of acetate within the reactor. In phase 2, the control reactor continued to decrease the methane production, and a methane conversion rate was only 3{\%} in the control, while 35 and 10{\%} in continuously-added and intermittently-added reactors, respectively. Thus, it was confirmed that the MPB activity was greatly enhanced under control of the SRB activity by the continuous addition of molybdate. Comparing phase 2 with phase 1, addition from the start-up of the process is considered more effective than addition after the methane production dropped in the control of the sulfate reduction by molybdate.},

Our analysis confirmed that methanogenesis genes (including mtd, mer, frh and mcr) were upregulated under hydrogen-limited conditions, while some of them were affected by other environmental stimuli. Concerning stress responses of this organism, several unique features were revealed. First, there was no universal stress response in this organism. Second, genes for alternative redox enzymes, such as rubrerythrin, were upregulated under the oxidative stress, but those for typical antioxidant enzymes were not. Third, genes relevant to the modification of cell surface structures were differentially expressed under stress conditions. Finally, energy-requiring CO(2) assimilation systems were downregulated under stress conditions. These findings suggest that M. thermautotrophicus has complex transcriptional regulation mechanisms that facilitate it to survive in unstable ecosystems such as an anaerobic digester.},

abstract = {We live on a cold planet where more than 80{\%} of the biosphere is permanently below 5 degrees C, and yet comparatively little is known about the genetics and physiology of the microorganisms inhabiting these environments. Based on molecular probe and sequencing studies, it is clear that Archaea are numerically abundant in diverse low-temperature environments throughout the globe. In addition, non-low-temperature-adapted Archaea are commonly exposed to sudden decreases in temperature, as are other microorganisms, animals, and plants. Considering their ubiquity in nature, it is perhaps surprising to find that there is such a lack of knowledge regarding low-temperature adaptation mechanisms in Archaea, particularly in comparison to what is known about archaeal thermophiles and hyperthermophiles and responses to heat shock. This review covers what is presently known about adaptation to cold shock and growth at low temperature, with a particular focus on Antarctic Archaea. The review highlights the similarities and differences that exist between Archaea and Bacteria and eukaryotes, and addresses the potentially important role that protein synthesis plays in adaptation to the cold. By reviewing the present state of the field, a number of important areas for future research are identified.},

abstract = {To understand the physiological basis of methanogenic archaea living on interspecies H(2) transfer, the protein expression of a hydrogenotrophic methanogen, Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus strain $\Delta$H, was investigated in both pure culture and syntrophic coculture with an anaerobic butyrate oxidizer Syntrophothermus lipocalidus strain TGB-C1 as an H(2) supplier. Comparative proteomic analysis showed that global protein expression of methanogen cells in the model coculture was substantially different from that of pure cultured cells. In brief, in syntrophic coculture, although methanogenesis-driven energy generation appeared to be maintained by shifting the pathway to the alternative methyl coenzyme M reductase isozyme I and cofactor F(420)-dependent process, the machinery proteins involved in carbon fixation, amino acid synthesis, and RNA/DNA metabolisms tended to be down-regulated, indicating restrained cell growth rather than vigorous proliferation. In addition, our proteome analysis revealed that $\alpha$ subunits of proteasome were differentially acetylated between the two culture conditions. Since the relevant modification has been suspected to regulate proteolytic activity of the proteasome, the global protein turnover rate could be controlled under syntrophic growth conditions. To our knowledge, the present study is the first report on N-acetylation of proteasome subunits in methanogenic archaea. These results clearly indicated that physiological adaptation of hydrogenotrophic methanogens to syntrophic growth is more complicated than that of hitherto proposed.},

In this review, we provide a state of the art survey how S-layer proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides may be used as basic building blocks for the assembly of S-layer supported lipid membranes. These biomimetic membrane systems are distinguished by a nanopatterned fluidity, enhanced stability and longevity and thus, provide a dedicated reconstitution matrix for membrane-active peptides and transmembrane proteins.

abstract = {Biogas production from renewable resources is attracting increased attention as an alternative energy source due to the limited availability of traditional fossil fuels. Many countries are promoting the use of alternative energy sources for sustainable energy production. In this study, a metagenome from a production-scale biogas fermenter was analysed employing Roche's GS FLX Titanium technology and compared to a previous dataset obtained from the same community DNA sample that was sequenced on the GS FLX platform. Taxonomic profiling based on 16S rRNA-specific sequences and an Environmental Gene Tag (EGT) analysis employing CARMA demonstrated that both approaches benefit from the longer read lengths obtained on the Titanium platform. Results confirmed Clostridia as the most prevalent taxonomic class, whereas species of the order Methanomicrobiales are dominant among methanogenic Archaea. However, the analyses also identified additional taxa that were missed by the previous study, including members of the genera Streptococcus, Acetivibrio, Garciella, Tissierella, and Gelria, which might also play a role in the fermentation process leading to the formation of methane. Taking advantage of the CARMA feature to correlate taxonomic information of sequences with their assigned functions, it appeared that Firmicutes, followed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, dominate within the functional context of polysaccharide degradation whereas Methanomicrobiales represent the most abundant taxonomic group responsible for methane production. Clostridia is the most important class involved in the reductive CoA pathway (Wood-Ljungdahl pathway) that is characteristic for acetogenesis. Based on binning of 16S rRNA-specific sequences allocated to the dominant genus Methanoculleus, it could be shown that this genus is represented by several different species. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences placed them in close proximity to the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanoculleus bourgensis. While rarefaction analyses still indicate incomplete coverage, examination of the GS FLX Titanium dataset resulted in the identification of additional genera and functional elements, providing a far more complete coverage of the community involved in anaerobic fermentative pathways leading to methane formation.},

The cobalt speciation was studied with three different media that contained varying concentrations of complexing ligands [carbonates, phosphates and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)]. Three fractions (nominal added, dissolved and free) of cobalt were determined in the liquid media and were correlated with data from batch toxicity experiments. The average concentration of cobalt that was required for 50{\%} inhibition of methanogenic activity (IC50) for free Co2+ in the three sets of measurements was 13 micromol/L with a standard deviation of 22{\%} and a similarity of 72{\%} between the data obtained in the three different media for the range of cobalt concentrations investigated. The standard deviation of the IC50 for the other two fractions was much higher, i.e. 85 and 144{\%} for the added cobalt and dissolved cobalt, respectively, and the similarity was almost 0{\%} for both fractions. Complexation (and precipitation) with EDTA, phosphates and carbonates was shown to decrease the toxicity of cobalt on methylotrophic methanogenesis. The free cobalt concentration is proposed to be the key parameter to correlate with cobalt toxicity.

abstract = {Comparison of the updated complete nucleotide sequences of the two related plasmids pME2001 and pME2200 from the thermophilic archaeon Methanothermobacter marburgensis (formerly Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum) strains Marburg and ZH3, respectively, revealed an almost identical common backbone structure and five plasmid-specific inserted fragments (IFs), four of which are flanked by perfect or nearly perfect direct repeats 25-52 bp in length. A 4354-bp minimal replicon was derived from the alignment of the two plasmids, which encodes one putative antisense RNA related to replication control and five open reading frames (ORFs) organized in two operons. The first operon consists of four ORFs, the third of which, i.e. ORF3, contains a helix-turn-helix motif and a purine NTP-binding motif often found in proteins involved in DNA metabolic processes. The database search results suggest that ORF3 might function as a replication initiator protein. The large putative Rep protein encoded by pME2001 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal His-tagged version using pET28a and a compatible helper plasmid that coexpresses minor tRNAs, argU and ileX to compensate for codon usage difference. ORFs 1, 2, and 3 are organized in a sequence reminiscent of that described in E. coli plasmids of the R1 family, cop-tap-rep. ORF6 encoded by IF1, one of the pME2200-specific elements, showed significant similarity to ORF6 encoded by archaeal phage psiM2 of M. marburgensis strain Marburg and may confer the apparent immunity of its host strain ZH3 to infection by phage psiM2. Our data indicate that M. marburgensis plasmids may evolve by a series of gene duplication and excision events.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effect of different feeding regimes on the cobalt sorption capacity of anaerobic granular sludge from a full-scale bioreactor treating paper mill wastewater. Adsorption experiments were done with non-fed granules in monometal (only Co) and competitive conditions (Co and Ni in equimolar concentrations). In order to modify the extracellular polymeric substances and sulfides content of the granules, the sludge was fed for 30 days with glucose (pH 7, 30 °C, organic loading rate = 1.2 g glucose l-1 day-1) in the presence (COD/SO42- = 1) or absence of sulfate. The partitioning of the sorbed cobalt between the exchangeable, carbonates, organic matter/sulfides and residual fractions was determined using a sequential extraction procedure (modified Tessier). Experimental equilibrium sorption data for cobalt were analysed by the Langmuir, Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson isotherm equations. The total Langmuir maximal sorption capacity of the sludge fed with glucose and sulfate loaded with cobalt alone displayed a significantly higher maximal cobalt sorption (Qmax = 18.76 mg g-1 TSS) than the sludge fed with glucose alone (Qmax = 13.21 mg g-1 TSS), essentially due to an increased sorption capacity of the exchangeable (30-107{\%}) and organic/sulfides fractions (70-30{\%}). Environmental scanning electron microscopy coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray analysis of granular cross-sections showed that mainly iron minerals (i.e. iron sulfides) were involved in the cobalt accumulation. Moreover, the sorbed cobalt was mainly located at the edge of the granules. The sorption characteristics of the exchangeable and carbonates fractions fitted well to the Redlich-Peterson model (intermediate multi-layer sorption behaviour), whereas the sorption characteristics of the organic matter/sulfides and residual fractions fitted well to the Langmuir model (monolayer sorption behaviour). The organic matter/sulfides fraction displayed the highest affinity for cobalt for the three sludge types investigated.},

abstract = {Research on the anaerobic treatment of raw cheese whey started in 1990 with the objective of developing a technology suitable for medium size cheese factories that have growing disposal problems and cannot afford high investment costs for whey valorisation technologies (such as whey protein and lactose recovery, spray drying, etc.). In order to couple process stability and high loads, a new downflow-upflow hybrid reactor (DUHR) has been designed. The reactor was able to reach Bv values around 10 g COD{\textperiodcentered}1-1{\textperiodcentered}d-1, with 98{\%} COD converted to gas and effluent soluble COD values close to 1,000 ppm; no external addition of alkalinity is required to maintain a stable pH that was constantly around 6.5-6.7 in the downflow pre-acidification chamber and around 7.5 in the bio-methanation upflow chamber. The high strength of the cheese whey treated gives an effluent that still contains high amounts of COD, ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus and therefore a post treatment is required in order to meet standard limits. Tests of post treatment were carried out during two years with a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR). The SBR was tested at various F/M values with different durations of anoxic-anaerobic-oxic cycles, obtaining, under certain conditions, more than 90{\%} removal of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus.},

The enrichment cultures were characterized at each subculturing step by 16S rRNA gene Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. About 90{\%} of spiked polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were stoichiometrically converted into di- and tri-chlorinated congeners by each enriched culture via dechlorination of flanked para chlorines and ortho-flanked meta chlorines. A 2-fold increase in PCB-dechlorination rate, the disappearance of lag phase, as well as a remarkable increase of sulfate consumption and a decline of methanogenic activity, were observed throughout subculturing. A reduction of complexity of the archaeal community, which was composed by Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales, was also observed as a result of culture enrichment. The bacterial community included members of the Alpha, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon divisions of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Chloroflexi. Two sequence phylotypes related to the genus Sulforovum and the species Desulfococcus multivorans and two Chloroflexi enriched throughout subculturing, thus suggesting that these bacteria were involved in PCB dechlorination in the marine sediments of Brentella canal.},

The wastewater which was treated in the UASB reactor contained mainly starch, acetate, propionate, butyrate and formate, and had a chemical oxygen demand/sulfate ratio of 9.5. Evidence was obtained that acetate was mainly degraded by Methanosaeta-like microorganisms, while propionate was the preferred substrate for sulfate reduction. The Desulfobulbus-like propionate-degrading sulfate reducers in the sludge competed with Syntrophobacter-like bacteria for the available propionate. Hydrogen and formate were probably mainly degraded via methanogenesis by members of the order Methanobacteriales. Hydrogen, formate and butyrate-degrading sulfate reducers could not be characterized with the 16S rRNA probes available to date. The same was true for syntrophic butyrate degraders.},

abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) is the most important substrate for biogas production in Germany. This study was conducted to determine the influence of harvest date and hybrid maturity on the yield and quality of maize biomass for anaerobic methane production. In 2004 and 2005, maize hybrids of widely contrasting maturity were grown on a loamy sand soil (Haplic Luvisol) near Braunschweig, Germany. Whole-plant yield was determined several times after female flowering and the biomass analysed for nutrient composition. The specific methane yield (SMY) was measured using 20 l batch digesters. In both experimental years, the late energy maize prototypes had a lower concentration of fat and protein, but higher concentration of ash, detergent fibre, and lignin as compared with the climatically adapted medium-early hybrids. Despite substantially different nutrient concentration among the maize hybrids, no clear-cut association existed between chemical composition and specific methane yield. Contrary to the medium-early hybrids, the late hybrids attained both maximum specific methane yield and maximum methane hectare yields at the final harvest date. In the very long growing season of 2004, the highest individual methane yield of 9370 N m3 ha-1 was obtained by the hybrid with the latest maturity used in the study. It appears that late energy maize, which can take full advantage of the growing season, is better suited for biogas production, provided that the whole-plant dry matter concentration is high enough to produce good quality silage.},

Universal probes also serve to normalize results obtained with probes targeting specific phylogenetic groups of microorganisms. In this study, six universal probes were evaluated for stability of probe-target duplexes by using rRNA from nine organisms representing the three domains of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucarya. Domain-specific variations in dissociation temperatures were observed for all probes. This could lead to a significant bias when these probes are used to quantify microbial populations in environmental samples. We suggest lowering the posthybridization wash stringency for two of the universal probes (S-*-Univ-1390-a-A-18 and S-*-Univ-1392-a-A-15) examined. These two probes were evaluated with traditional and modified hybridization conditions to characterize defined mixtures of rRNAs extracted from pure cultures and rRNA samples obtained from anaerobic digester samples.

abstract = {Minerotrophic fen peatlands are widely distributed in northern latitudes and, because of their rapid turnover of organic matter, are potentially larger sources of atmospheric methane than bog peatlands per unit area. However, studies of the archaeal community composition in fens are scarce particularly in minerotrophic sites. Several 16S rRNA-based primer sets were used to obtain a broad characterization of the archaeal community in a minerotrophic fen in central New York State. A wide archaeal diversity was observed in the site: 11 euryarchaeal and 2 crenarchaeal groups, most of which were uncultured. The E1 group, a novel cluster in the order Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosaetaceae were the codominant groups in all libraries and results of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. Given its abundance and potential hydrogenotrophic methane contribution, the E1 group was targeted for culture attempts with a low-ionic-strength medium (PM1). Initial attempts yielded Methanospirillum-dominated cultures. However, by incorporating a T-RFLP analysis as a quick selection tool for treatments and replicates, we were able to select an enrichment dominated by E1. Further dilutions to 10(-9) and tracking with T-RFLP yielded a strain named E1-9c. E1-9c is a novel coccoid hydrogenotrophic, mesophilic, slightly acidophilic methanogen and is highly sensitive to Na(2)S concentrations (requires {\textless}0.12 mM for growth). We propose E1-9c as the first representative of a novel genus in the Methanomicrobiales order.},

On the basis of colony morphology, Gram reaction, and motility, the organism is classified as a new species of methanogenic bacterium, and the name Methanobacterium mobilis sp. n. is proposed.},

These methanogens were exclusively acetotrophic and had a characteristic sheathed structure. The DNA base compositions of the strains which we studied ranged from 50.3 to 54.3 mol{\%} guanine plus cytosine. The thermophilic strains often had phase-refractive gas vesicles inside their cells. Denaturing electrophoresis of proteins showed that the mesophilic and thermophilic Mefhanothrix strains formed two distinct groups and that there were differences in protein patterns between the groups. The difference between the thermophiles and mesophiles was also verified by comparing partial 16s rRNA sequences (ca. 30 base differences in ca. 540 bases). On the basis of our results, we propose the name Methanothrix thenophila for the three thermophilic strains. The type strain of M. thermophila is strain P, (= DSM 6194). We also propose that the name Methanothrix thenoacetophila (‘LMethanosaeta thermoaceto- phila”), which was given to strain 2-517 (type strain), should be rejected because of its description, which was based on an enrichment culture, was inadequate.

Combination of TS control of inoculum and batch operation during early days enabled the successful start-up operation without serious volatile fatty acid accumulation, followed by the stable continuous operation. However, the propionate degradation was rate-limiting step during the batch operation. The results of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that there was a correlation between the population of the genus Methanosarcina and the methane production rate coupled with acetate consumption during batch operation, and the results of terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) revealed that the increasing intensity of T-RF peaks of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was associated with a decrease in the level of C3-acids.},

abstract = {The two-phase leach-bed system is a biogas reactor system optimized for the utilization of energy crop silages at maximized loading rates under maintenance of an optimal microbial activity. In this study, a characterization of the methanogenic microbial community within this reactor system was conducted for the first time. Accordingly, effluent samples from the anaerobic filter and the silage digesting leach-bed reactors of both a laboratory-scale two-phase biogas reactor system and a scaled-up commercial on-farm pilot plant were investigated. In total, five Archaea-specific 16S rDNA libraries were constructed and analyzed by amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), with subsequent phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences for individual ARDRA patterns. A quantification of major methanogenic Archaea groups was conducted by real-time PCR. A total of 663 clones were analyzed and 45 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) related to methanogenic Archaea were detected. These OTUs were related to the orders Methanosarcinales, Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales, as well as the hitherto uncultured CA-11 and ARC-I groups, and most of them occurred throughout all the compartments of both two-phase biogas reactors. The proportion of acetotrophic to hydrogenotrophic methanogens differed between the laboratory and the pilot scale system. A total of 56{\%} of the clones from the 16S rDNA library derived from the laboratory biogas system were assigned to presumably acetotrophic members of Methanosarcinales. In contrast, these OTUs were less abundant in the 16S rDNA library derived from samples of the pilot plant. Therein, the most dominant OTUs were Methanoculleus-related OTUs, which presumably indicated the predominant presence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. These findings were confirmed by group-specific quantitative real-time PCR assays. The results indicated that the fraction of acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens within a biogas reactor caused certain variations, which may reflect varying substrate utilization during methanogenesis.},

abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) is the most important substrate for biogas production in Germany. This study was conducted to determine the influence of harvest date and hybrid maturity on the yield and quality of maize biomass for anaerobic methane production. In 2004 and 2005, maize hybrids of widely contrasting maturity were grown on a loamy sand soil (Haplic Luvisol) near Braunschweig, Germany. Whole-plant yield was determined several times after female flowering and the biomass analysed for nutrient composition. The specific methane yield (SMY) was measured using 20 l batch digesters. In both experimental years, the late energy maize prototypes had a lower concentration of fat and protein, but higher concentration of ash, detergent fibre, and lignin as compared with the climatically adapted medium-early hybrids. Despite substantially different nutrient concentration among the maize hybrids, no clear-cut association existed between chemical composition and specific methane yield. Contrary to the medium-early hybrids, the late hybrids attained both maximum specific methane yield and maximum methane hectare yields at the final harvest date. In the very long growing season of 2004, the highest individual methane yield of 9370 N m3 ha-1 was obtained by the hybrid with the latest maturity used in the study. It appears that late energy maize, which can take full advantage of the growing season, is better suited for biogas production, provided that the whole-plant dry matter concentration is high enough to produce good quality silage.},

abstract = {A predominant methanogenic bacterium was isolated from salt-marsh sediment near Pawley's Island, South Carolina. A habitat-simulating medium with H2:CO2 as substrate was used for enrichment and isolation. The methanogen is strictly anaerobic, weakly-motile, non-sporeforming, Gram negative, and a pleomorphic coccoid-rod averaging 1.2 by 1.6 $\mu$m. Colonies are circular, translucent, pale yellow, and have a smooth surface and an entire edge. The organism is a mesophile, growing between 18 and 47°C, with an optimum near 38°C. The pH optimum for growth is 6.8–7.2, and only formate or a mixture of H2 plus CO2 serve as substrates. Seawater (20–70{\%} v/v) is required, but it can be replaced by 15 mM, or greater, magnesium. Optimal growth occurs with 110 mM sodium. Growth rate is stimulated by selenium (10 $\mu$M) but organic compounds (acetate, vitamins, amino acids) are neither stimulatory nor required. The methanogen grows well in autotrophic medium with a doubling time of about 2h. Cells are fragile, are lysed by aqueous solutions of low osmolality and by detergents, and the lack muramic acid. The cell wall is a single electron dense layer. The DNA base composition is 33 mol {\%} guanine plus cytosine. Antigenic relationship of cells and the 16S ribosomal RNA catalog indicate that the salt marsh methanogen is a unique species of Methanococcus, for which we propose the name Methanococcus maripaludis sp. nov.},

The high strength of the cheese whey treated gives an effluent that still contains high amounts of COD, ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus and therefore a post treatment is required in order to meet standard limits. Tests of post treatment were carried out during two years with a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR). The SBR was tested at various F/M values with different durations of anoxic-anaerobic-oxic cycles, obtaining, under certain conditions, more than 90{\%} removal of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus.},

The Ca(2+) uptake requires intravesicular Na(+) and is stimulated by an inside positive membrane potential.

abstract = {Previous work showed that Methanobacillus omelianskii was a mixed culture of an ethanol-oxidizing organism called S organism and a hydrogen-utilizing methane bacterium, strain MOH. S organism grows poorly on ethanol unless a hydrogen-utilizing methanogenic bacterium is included to utilize the H(2) produced during growth. Further studies have shown that, among many substrates tested, only ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, n-pentanol, acetaldehyde, oxalacetate, and pyruvate are fermented by S organism, either alone or in combination with Methanobacterium ruminantium. It grew better in pure culture with pyruvate than with alcohols. H(2) gas phase inhibited growth on pyruvate as well as on alcohol. When grown alone on pyruvate, S organism produced mainly acetate, ethanol, and CO(2), in addition to a small amount of H(2). When combined with M. ruminantium, no H(2) and very little ethanol were produced and acetate production was increased. When M. ruminantium was present, electrons from pyruvate oxidation by S organism were channeled almost entirely to H(2) and hence to methane formation rather than ethanol. Also, S organism utilized more pyruvate when grown with M. ruminantium. Attempts to obtain better growth of S organism on ethanol by addition of many possible electron acceptors were unsuccessful. It grew best between 32 and 45 C, had a per cent guanine plus cytosine content of deoxyribonucleic acid bases of 47.27 +/- 0.1, contained no cytochrome, and could be grown on a defined medium with pyruvate as the energy and carbon source and with (NH(4))(2)SO(4) as the main nitrogen source.

abstract = {The microbial diversity and metabolic potential of a methanogenic consortium residing in a 3785-liter anaerobic digester, fed with wastewater algae, was analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing technology. DNA was extracted from anaerobic sludge material and used in metagenomic analysis through PCR amplification of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase $\alpha$ subunit (mcrA) gene using primer sets ML, MCR, and ME. The majority of annotated mcrA sequences were assigned taxonomically to the genera Methanosaeta in the order Methanosarcinales. Methanogens from the genus Methanosaeta are obligate acetotrophs, suggesting this genus plays a dominant role in methane production from the analyzed fermentation sample. Numerous analyzed sequences within the algae fed anaerobic digester were unclassified and could not be assigned taxonomically. Relative amplicon frequencies were determined for each primer set to determine the utility of each in pyrosequencing. Primer sets ML and MCR performed better quantitatively (representing the large majority of analyzed sequences) than primer set ME. However, each of these primer sets was shown to provide a quantitatively unique community structure, and thus they are of equal importance in mcrA metagenomic analysis.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Candidiasis are life-threatening systemic fungal diseases, especially of gastro intestinal track, skin and mucous membranes lining various body cavities like the nostrils, the mouth, the lips, the eyelids, the ears or the genital area. Due to increasing resistance of candidiasis to existing drugs, it is very important to look for new strategies helping the treatment of such fungal diseases. One promising strategy is the use of the probiotic microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit. Such a probiotic microorganism is yeast {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Saccharomyces boulardii{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, a close relative of baker yeast. {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Saccharomyces boulardii{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} cells and their extract affect the virulence factors of the important human fungal pathogen {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. albicans{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, its hyphae formation, adhesion and biofilm development. Extract prepared from {\textless}italic{\textgreater}S. boulardii{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} culture filtrate was fractionated and GC-MS analysis showed that the active fraction contained, apart from 2-phenylethanol, caproic, caprylic and capric acid whose presence was confirmed by ESI-MS analysis. Biological activity was tested on {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. albicans{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} using extract and pure identified compounds. Our study demonstrated that this probiotic yeast secretes into the medium active compounds reducing candidal virulence factors. The chief compound inhibiting filamentous {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. albicans{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} growth comparably to {\textless}italic{\textgreater}S. boulardii{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} extract was capric acid, which is thus responsible for inhibition of hyphae formation. It also reduced candidal adhesion and biofilm formation, though three times less than the extract, which thus contains other factors suppressing {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. albicans{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} adherence. The expression profile of selected genes associated with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. albicans{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} virulence by real-time PCR showed a reduced expression of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}HWP1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}INO1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}CSH1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} genes in {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. albicans{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} cells treated with capric acid and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}S. boulardii{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} extract. Hence capric acid secreted by {\textless}italic{\textgreater}S. boulardii{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} is responsible for inhibition of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. albicans{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} filamentation and partially also adhesion and biofilm formation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Biosorption of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) in the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) treatment process was investigated using batch tests and continuous reactor runs. Batch experiments were conducted, for characterization of the biosorption, with two active and one inactivated (autoclaved) sludge granules as sorbents and with a single (oleic acid) or a mixture of LCFA (LCFAm; 50{\%} oleic, 35{\%} palmitic and 15{\%} stearic acid) as sorbates. The LCFAm showed a faster adsorption onto the granules than oleic acid. With the active sludge granules, adsorption was followed by desorption. Methane production increased significantly, either simultaneously (at lower LCFA concentrations) or succeedingly (at higher concentrations) with desorption. The desorption was mediated by biological activity, since it did not prevail with inactivated granules or with active granules inhibited at higher LCFAm concentrations. The inactivated granules had a slightly higher initial biosorption capacity. Increased LCFA concentrations resulted in more LCFA adsorbed and greater inhibition of their biodegradation. A hypothesis is proposed to explicate the relationship between biosorption, desorption and biodegradation of LCFA by sludge granules: adsorption is a prerequisite for biodegradation while desorption is a consequence of biodegradation. Isothermal studies with oleate showed that the apparent biosorption could be described by the physical multilayer adsorption theory and the sorption isotherm derived was consistent with the Freundlich model. The quantitative relation between LCFA biosorption and granular sludge flotation was investigated in a UASB reactor fed with LCFAm. Sludge flotation depended on the LCFAm loading rate rather than on their concentration. The higher the loading implemented, the more flotation occurred and the shorter time required for complete flotation of the sludge bed. Flotation started when the LCFAm loading rate exceeded 0.09 g COD/g VSS{\textperiodcentered}d, while complete flotation occurred at the loading rates exceeding 0.2 g COD/g VSS{\textperiodcentered}d. These results suggest that sludge bed wash-out is likely to be encountered before inhibition of methanogenesis during the treatment of LCFA-containing wastewaters by the UASB process.},

The total intracellular coenzyme F420 content of Methanosarcina barkeri MS cultivated on methanol and on H2-CO2 and of Methanosarcina mazei S-6 cultured on methanol remained relatively constant during batch growth. The most abundant analogs in M. barkeri were coenzymes F420-2 and F420-4, whilst in M. mazei coenzymes F420-2 and F420-3 predominated. Significant changes in the relative proportions of the coenzyme F420 analogs were noted during batch growth, with coenzymes F420-2 and F420-4 showing opposite responses to each other and the same being also true for coenzymes F420-3 and F420-5. This suggests that an enzyme responsible for transferring pairs of glutamic acid residues may be active. The degradation fragment FO was also detected in cells in late exponential and stationary phase. Coenzyme F420 analogs were present in the culture supernatant of both methanogens, in similar proportions to that in the cells, except for FO which was principally located in the supernatant.},

@article{Wirth2012,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Renewable energy production is currently a major issue worldwide. Biogas is a promising renewable energy carrier as the technology of its production combines the elimination of organic waste with the formation of a versatile energy carrier, methane. In consequence of the complexity of the microbial communities and metabolic pathways involved the biotechnology of the microbiological process leading to biogas production is poorly understood. Metagenomic approaches are suitable means of addressing related questions. In the present work a novel high-throughput technique was tested for its benefits in resolving the functional and taxonomical complexity of such microbial consortia. RESULTS: It was demonstrated that the extremely parallel SOLiDTM short-read DNA sequencing platform is capable of providing sufficient useful information to decipher the systematic and functional contexts within a biogas-producing community. Although this technology has not been employed to address such problems previously, the data obtained compare well with those from similar high-throughput approaches such as 454-pyrosequencing GS FLX or Titanium. The predominant microbes contributing to the decomposition of organic matter include members of the Eubacteria, class Clostridia, order Clostridiales, family Clostridiaceae. Bacteria belonging in other systematic groups contribute to the diversity of the microbial consortium. Archaea comprise a remarkably small minority in this community, given their crucial role in biogas production. Among the Archaea, the predominant order is the Methanomicrobiales and the most abundant species is Methanoculleus marisnigri. The Methanomicrobiales are hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Besides corroborating earlier findings on the significance of the contribution of the Clostridia to organic substrate decomposition, the results demonstrate the importance of the metabolism of hydrogen within the biogas producing microbial community. CONCLUSIONS: Both microbiological diversity and the regulatory role of the hydrogen metabolism appear to be the driving forces optimizing biogas-producing microbial communities. The findings may allow a rational design of these communities to promote greater efficacy in large-scale practical systems. The composition of an optimal biogas-producing consortium can be determined through the use of this approach, and this systematic methodology allows the design of the optimal microbial community structure for any biogas plant. In this way, metagenomic studies can contribute to significant progress in the efficacy and economic improvement of biogas production.},

Modern analytical techniques to investigate fungal degradation and modification of the lignin polymer are reviewed, as are the different oxidative enzymes (oxidoreductases) involved in lignin degradation. These include laccases, high redox potential ligninolytic peroxidases (lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and versatile peroxidase), and oxidases. Special emphasis is given to the reactions catalyzed, their synergistic action on lignin, and the structural bases for their unique catalytic properties. Broadening our knowledge of lignocellulose biodegradation processes should contribute to better control of wood-decaying fungi, as well as to the development of new biocatalysts of industrial interest based on these organisms and their enzymes.},

abstract = {We have used a variety of methods to characterize the genome of the archaeon Methanosarcina thermophila TM-1. Pulsed-field gel analysis indicates a genome size of 2.8 Mb. We have constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of M. thermophila and have used it to generate physical maps for this organism. The library is made up of 384 clones with an average insert size of 58 kb representing 8.0 genome equivalents. The utility of the library for low-resolution physical mapping was shown by identifying NotI linking clones and using these to order the NotI macrorestriction fragments of M. thermophila into a 2.8 Mb map. Hybridization of nine single copy genes and a 16S rRNA sequence to these macrorestriction fragments forms the basis for the first genetic map in this organism. High-resolution physical maps, consisting of overlapping clones, have been created using HindIII fingerprints of BAC clones. In this way, we identified a minimal path of five clones that span a 270 kb NotI fragment. The ease of manipulating BAC clones makes the BAC system an excellent choice for the construction of low-resolution and high-resolution physical and genetic maps of archaeal genomes. It also provides a substrate for future genome-sequencing efforts.},

@article{Lebuhn2008,
abstract = {Biogas production from mono-digestion of maize silage was studied for more than one year in six continuously stirred, daily fed 36 L fermenters. Chemical and microbiological parameters were analysed concomitantly. The reactors acidified already after 8 months of operation at a low organic loading rate (OLR) of 2 g VS*(L*d)(-1). The TVA/TAC ratio was the most reliable parameter to indicate early process instabilities leading to acidification. A TVA/TAC threshold of 0.5 should not be exceeded. After acidification and recovery of the fermenters, propionic acid was no reliable parameter anymore to indicate process failure, since values far below the threshold of 1 g*L(-1) were obtained although the process had collapsed.The acidified reactors recovered better, showed greatly improved stability and allowed a higher OLR when a trace element (TE) cocktail was supplemented. Hydrolysis was obviously not process-limiting, results indicated that methanogens were affected. The most limiting element in long-term mono-digestion of maize silage turned out to be cobalt, but data obtained suggest that molybdenum and selenium should also be provided. TE supplementation should be designed specifically in order to meet the actual needs. TE availability for the biocenosis appears to be a key issue in biogas production, not only in mono-but also in co-digestion processes.},

This paper presents the results where apple pulp was co-digested with slaughterhouse waste (pig intestine and bovine stomach content) in a biogas laboratory unit (10 l CSTR reactor). The production of biogas has reached very satisfactory values during the whole test (0.8m(3)kg(-1)OTS), verifying that the process is kept in stable conditions of pH (near 8.0), and the volatile fatty acids was always underneath 3000 mg/l, when the pulp amount was lower than 100g in mesophilic conditions. The fat concentration into the digester remained always below the value that causes inhibition of the methanogenic bacteria, 500 mg/l. Finally, methane concentration (77-80{\%}) and H(2)S concentration (400 ppm) in the biogas, they were similar to those obtained when the test was run out in the absence of apple pulp. The process efficiency with respect to COD removal was high, near 80{\%} of the total COD.

abstract = {This article describes the use of biofilm reactors for the production of various chemicals by fermentation and wastewater treatment. Biofilm formation is a natural process where microbial cells attach to the support (adsorbent) or form flocs/aggregates (also called granules) without use of chemicals and form thick layers of cells known as "biofilms." As a result of biofilm formation, cell densities in the reactor increase and cell concentrations as high as 74 gL(-1) can be achieved. The reactor configurations can be as simple as a batch reactor, continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), packed bed reactor (PBR), fluidized bed reactor (FBR), airlift reactor (ALR), upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor, or any other suitable configuration. In UASB granular biofilm particles are used. This article demonstrates that reactor productivities in these reactors have been superior to any other reactor types. This article describes production of ethanol, butanol, lactic acid, acetic acid/vinegar, succinic acid, and fumaric acid in addition to wastewater treatment in the biofilm reactors. As the title suggests, biofilm reactors have high potential to be employed in biotechnology/bioconversion industry for viable economic reasons. In this article, various reactor types have been compared for the above bioconversion processes.},

abstract = {Archaeosomes (liposomes comprised of glycerolipids of Archaea) constitute potent adjuvants for the induction of Th1, Th2 and CD8(+) T cell responses to the entrapped soluble antigen. Archaeal lipids are uniquely constituted of ether-linked isoprenoid phytanyl cores conferring stability to the membranes. Additionally, varied head groups displayed on the glycerol-lipid cores facilitate unique immunostimulating interactions with mammalian antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The polar lipid from the archaeon, Methanobrevibacter smithii has been well characterized for its adjuvant potential, and is abundant in archaetidyl serine, promoting interaction with a phosphatidylserine receptor on APCs. These archaeosomes mediate MHC class I cross-priming via the phagosome-to-cytosol TAP-dependent classical processing pathway, and also upregulate costimulation by APCs without overt inflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, they facilitate potent CD8(+) T cell memory to co-delivered antigen, comparable in magnitude and quality to live bacterial vaccine vectors. Archaeosome vaccines provide profound protection in murine models of infection and cancer. This technology is being developed for clinical application and offers a novel prospect for rational design and development of safe and potent subunit vaccines capable of eliciting T cell immunity against intracellular infections and cancers.},

abstract = {Microbial community diversity in two thermophilic laboratory-scale and three full-scale anaerobic co-digesters was analysed by genetic profiling based on PCR-amplified partial 16S rRNA genes. In parallel operated laboratory reactors a stepwise increase of the organic loading rate (OLR) resulted in a decrease of methane production and an accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). However, almost threefold different OLRs were necessary to inhibit the gas production in the reactors. During stable reactor performance, no significant differences in the bacterial community structures were detected, except for in the archaeal communities. Sequencing of archaeal PCR products revealed a dominance of the acetoclastic methanogen Methanosarcina thermophila, while hydrogenotrophic methanogens were of minor importance and differed additionally in their abundance between reactors. As a consequence of the perturbation, changes in bacterial and archaeal populations were observed. After organic overload, hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanospirillum hungatei and Methanoculleus receptaculi) became more dominant, especially in the reactor attributed by a higher OLR capacity. In addition, aggregates composed of mineral and organic layers formed during organic overload and indicated tight spatial relationships between minerals and microbial processes that may support de-acidification processes in over-acidified sludge. Comparative analyses of mesophilic stationary phase full-scale reactors additionally indicated a correlation between the diversity of methanogens and the VFA concentration combined with the methane yield. This study demonstrates that the coexistence of two types of methanogens, i.e. hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens is necessary to respond successfully to perturbation and leads to stable process performance.},

abstract = {In this work, we review the state of knowledge of Archaea associated with the human microbiome. These prokaryotes, initially discovered in extreme environments, were named Archaea because these environments were thought to be the most primitive on Earth. Further research revealed that this terminology is misleading because these organisms were later found in various non-extreme environments, including the human host. Further examination of the human microbiome has enabled the isolation of three archaeal species, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Methanobrevibacter oralis, which are associated with oral, intestinal and vaginal mucosae in humans. Moreover, molecular studies including metagenomic analyses detected DNA sequences indicative of the presence of additional methanogenic and non-methanogenic Archaea in the human intestinal tract. All three culturable Archaea are strict anaerobes, although their potential role in human diseases remains to be established. Future research aims to detect and culture additional human mucosa-associated Archaea and to look for their presence in additional human tissues, to establish their role in human infections involving complex flora.},

abstract = {Prokaryote communities in post-glacial profundal freshwater sediments of Windermere, representing 10-12,000 years of deposition, were examined for culturability, viability and community structure. The potential for active geochemical cycles was inferred from the presence of specific groups of bacteria. Direct count procedures revealed 10(12) cells (g dry wt sediment)-1 in the surface sediments, which declined to approximately 10(9) cells (g dry wt sediment)-1 at 6 m depth of core (Representing approximately 10,000 years of deposition). The majority of the cells in the upper sediments were metabolically active when challenged with viability probes and responded to the direct viable count method. Below 250 cm, viability shown by 5-cyano-2,3-diotyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) dye was not significantly different from the direct count; however, counts obtained with 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) and the direct viable count both declined significantly from the direct count below 250 cm and 1 m, respectively. Culture was achieved from samples throughout the core, although the numbers of culturable bacteria decreased significantly with depth, from 10(7) c.f.u. (g dry wt sediment)-1 to 10(1)-10(2) c.f.u. (g dry wt sediment)-1 below 3 m depth. Among culturable isolates, Gram-positives and Gram-negatives were found at all levels of the core, and spore-forming heterotrophs dominated. Although sulphate-reducing bacteria were not detected below 20 cm, isolates demonstrating denitrifying activity were detected at all depths. PCR performed on samples taken below 3 m (deposited more than 7000 years ago) using eubacterial and archaeal primers revealed sequences similar to those found in deep sediments of the Pacific Ocean and the presence of methanogenic archaea. These observations indicate that bacteria and archaea are capable of long-term persistence and activity in deep, aged freshwater sediments.},

The addition of H2 to sediment significantly increased methanogenensis. The amount of methane produced was proportional to the concentration of hydrogen added. H2 addition stimulated the reduction of CO2 to methane, but did not significantly stimulate the conversion of methanol or the methyl position of acetate to methane. Various organic compounds also stimulated sediment methanogenesis. Formate, ethanol, and glucose were shown to serve as electron donors for CO2 reduction to methane. The addition of formate to sediment resulted in H2 evolution. H2 was not deith the phenomenon of interspecies hydrogen transfer. The results indicate that hydrogen is an important intermediate and a rate-limiting factor in sediment methanogenesis.},

abstract = {Archaea (archaebacteria) are a phenotypically diverse group of microorganisms that share a common evolutionary history. There are four general phenotypic groups of archaea: the methanogens, the extreme halophiles, the sulfate-reducing archaea, and the extreme thermophiles. In the marine environment, archaeal habitats are generally limited to shallow or deep-sea anaerobic sediments (free-living and endosymbiotic methanogens), hot springs or deep-sea hydrothermal vents (methanogens, sulfate reducers, and extreme thermophiles), and highly saline land-locked seas (halophiles). This report provides evidence for the widespread occurrence of unusual archaea in oxygenated coastal surface waters of North America. Quantitative estimates indicated that up to 2{\%} of the total ribosomal RNA extracted from coastal bacterioplankton assemblages was archaeal. Archaeal small-subunit ribosomal RNA-encoding DNAs (rDNAs) were cloned from mixed bacterioplankton populations collected at geographically distant sampling sites. Phylogenetic and nucleotide signature analyses of these cloned rDNAs revealed the presence of two lineages of archaea, each sharing the diagnostic signatures and structural features previously established for the domain Archaea. Both of these lineages were found in bacterioplankton populations collected off the east and west coasts of North America. The abundance and distribution of these archaea in oxic coastal surface waters suggests that these microorganisms represent undescribed physiological types of archaea, which reside and compete with aerobic, mesophilic eubacteria in marine coastal environments.},

Three commercially available measuring parameters, namely pH, the methane (CH4) content, and the specific gas production rate (spec. GPR = m3/kg VS/day) were included. The objective was to avoid stabilization of pH with use of buffering supplements, like lime or manure. The developed FLC system can cover most of all applications, such as a careful start-up process and a gentle recovery strategy after a severe reactor failure, also enabling a process with a high organic loading rate (OLR) and a low hydraulic retention time (HRT), that is, a high throughput anaerobic digestion process with a stable pH and CH4 content. A precondition for a high load process was the concept of interval feeding, for example, with 8 h of interval. The FLC system was proved to be reliable during the long term fermentation studies over 3 years in one-stage, completely stirred tank reactors (CSTR) with acidic beet silage as mono-input (pH 3.3–3.4). During fermentation of the fodder beet silage (FBS), a stable HRT of 6.0 days with an OLR of up to 15 kg VS/m3/day and a volumetric GPR of 9 m3/m3/day could be reached. The FLC enabled an automatic recovery of the digester after two induced severe reactor failures. In another attempt to prove the feasibility of the FLC, substrate FBS was changed to sugar beet silage (SBS), which had a substantially lower buffering capacity than that of the FBS. With SBS, the FLC accomplished a stable fermentation at a pH level between 6.5 and 6.6, and a volatile fatty acid level (VFA) below 500 mg/L, but the FLC had to interact and to change the substrate dosage permanently. In a further experiment, the reactor temperature was increased from 41 to 50°C. Concomitantly, the specific GPR, pH and CH4 dropped down.

abstract = {Distillery wastewater from awamori making was anaerobically treated for one year using thermophilic upflow anaerobic filter (UAF) reactors packed with pyridinium group-containing nonwoven fabric material. The microbial structure and spatial distribution of microorganisms on the support material were characterized using molecular biological methods. The reactor steadily achieved a high TOC loading rate of 18 g/l/d with approximately 80{\%} TOC removal efficiency when non-diluted wastewater was fed. The maximum TOC loading rate increased to 36 g/l/d when treating thrice-diluted wastewater. However, the TOC removal efficiency and gas evolution rate decreased compared with that when non-diluted wastewater was used. Methanogens closely related to Methanosarcina thermophila and Methanoculleus bourgensis and bacteria in the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were predominant methanogens and bacteria in the thermophilic UFA reactor, as indicated by 16S rRNA gene clone analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results showed that a large quantity of bacterial cells adhered throughout the whole support, and Methanosarcina-like methanogens existed mainly in the relative outside region while Methanoculleus cells were located in the relative inner part of the support. The support material used proved to be an excellent carrier for microorganisms, and a UAF reactor using this kind of support can be used for high-rate treatment of awamori/shochu distillery wastewater.},

abstract = {Abstract  Anaerobic digestion represents one of several commercially viable processes to convert woody biomass, agricultural wastes, and municipal solid wastes to methane gas, a useful energy source. This process occurs in the absence of oxygen, and is substantially less energy intensive than aerobic biological processes designed for disposal purposes. The anaerobic conversion process is a result of the synergistic effects of various microorganisms, which serve as a consortium. The rate-limiting step of this conversion process has been identified as the hydrolysis of cellulose, the major polymeric component of most biomass and waste feedstocks. Improvements in process economics therefore rely on improving the kinetic and physicochemical characteristics of cellulose degrading enzymes. The most thoroughly studied cellulase enzymes are produced by aerobic fungi, namelyTrichoderma reesei. However, the pH and temperature optima of fungal cellulases make them incompatible for use in anaerobic digestion systems, and the major populations of microorganisms involved in cellulase enzyme production under anaerobic digestion conditions are various bacterial producers. The current state of understanding of the major groups of bacterial cellulase producers is reviewed in this paper. Also addressed in this review are recently developed methods for the assessment of actual cellulase activity levels, reflective of the digester “hydrolytic potential,” using a series of detergent extractive procedures.},

abstract = {Although biofuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol represent a secure, renewable and environmentally safe alternative to fossil fuels, their economic viability is a major concern. The implementation of biorefineries that co-produce higher value products along with biofuels has been proposed as a solution to this problem. The biorefinery model would be especially advantageous if the conversion of byproducts or waste streams generated during biofuel production were considered. Glycerol-rich streams generated in large amounts by the biofuels industry, especially during the production of biodiesel, present an excellent opportunity to establish biorefineries. Once considered a valuable [`]co-product', crude glycerol is rapidly becoming a [`]waste product' with a disposal cost attributed to it. Given the highly reduced nature of carbon in glycerol and the cost advantage of anaerobic processes, fermentative metabolism of glycerol is of special interest. This review covers the anaerobic fermentation of glycerol in microbes and the harnessing of this metabolic process to convert abundant and low-priced glycerol streams into higher value products, thus creating a path to viability for the biofuels industry. Special attention is given to products whose synthesis from glycerol would be advantageous when compared with their production from common sugars.},

Here, we report the discovery and characterization of two Pgbs from the Archaea: ApPgb from the obligately aerobic hyperthermophile Aeropyrum pernix, and MaPgb from the strictly anaerobic methanogen Methanosarcina acetivorans. Both ApPgb and MaPgb bind molecular oxygen, nitric oxide, and carbon monoxide by means of a heme moiety that is coordinated to the protein through the F8 histidine (histidine 120). We postulate that these archaeal globins are the ancestors of contemporary hemoglobins.},

The method was based on microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of OA by an aqueous solution (10 mM) of sulphuric acid; extracts were subsequently analysed by ion-exclusion liquid chromatography associated with PhotoDiode Array detection (IE-LC-PDA). Chromatographic conditions (column temperature and mobile-phase composition) were screened to optimise separation. MAE operational parameters (extraction temperature, duration, and extractant molarity) were also evaluated. The effect of extractant molarity was not significant; however, the extraction temperature and duration exerted a significant effect (P{\textless}0.05) on the overall recovery of the majority of the target compounds. Recoveries {\textgreater}92{\%} were found for most target analytes in cheese but recoveries of tartaric, succinic, valeric, and propionic acids were lower (67-78{\%}). In the case of yoghurt, recoveries ranged from 78{\%} to 125{\%} but that of succinic acid was quite low (53{\%}). The overall performance of the proposed MAE-based method, compared to the commonly used extraction method by stirring, was found to be superior in terms of accuracy and repeatability.},

abstract = {Distillery wastewater from awamori making was anaerobically treated for one year using thermophilic upflow anaerobic filter (UAF) reactors packed with pyridinium group-containing nonwoven fabric material. The microbial structure and spatial distribution of microorganisms on the support material were characterized using molecular biological methods. The reactor steadily achieved a high TOC loading rate of 18 g/l/d with approximately 80{\%} TOC removal efficiency when non-diluted wastewater was fed. The maximum TOC loading rate increased to 36 g/l/d when treating thrice-diluted wastewater. However, the TOC removal efficiency and gas evolution rate decreased compared with that when non-diluted wastewater was used. Methanogens closely related to Methanosarcina thermophila and Methanoculleus bourgensis and bacteria in the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were predominant methanogens and bacteria in the thermophilic UFA reactor, as indicated by 16S rRNA gene clone analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results showed that a large quantity of bacterial cells adhered throughout the whole support, and Methanosarcina-like methanogens existed mainly in the relative outside region while Methanoculleus cells were located in the relative inner part of the support. The support material used proved to be an excellent carrier for microorganisms, and a UAF reactor using this kind of support can be used for high-rate treatment of awamori/shochu distillery wastewater.},

abstract = {All methanogenic Archaea examined to date rely on methanogenesis as their sole means of energy conservation. Among these are ones that use carbon monoxide as a growth substrate, producing methane via a pathway that involves hydrogen as an intermediate. To further examine the role of hydrogen in this process, we tested the ability of Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A, a metabolically versatile methanogen devoid of significant hydrogen metabolism, to use CO as a growth substrate. M. acetivorans grew on CO to high cell densities (approximately 1 x 10(8) per ml) with a doubling time of approximately 24 h. Surprisingly, acetate and formate, rather than methane, were the major metabolic end products as shown by 13C NMR studies and enzymatic analysis of culture supernatants. Methane formation surpassed acetate/formate formation only when the cultures entered stationary growth phase, strongly suggesting that M. acetivorans conserves energy by means of this acetogenic and formigenic process. Resting cell experiments showed that methane production decreased linearly with increasing CO partial pressures, consistent with inhibition of methanogenesis by CO. Transposon-induced M. acetivorans mutants with lesions in the operon encoding phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase failed to use either acetate or CO as growth substrates, indicating that these enzymes are required for both aceticlastic methanogenesis and carboxidotrophic acetogenesis. These findings greatly extend our concept of energy conservation and metabolic versatility in the methanogenic Archaea.},

abstract = {Although it is well known that methanol can be fermented directly by a specific species of methane bacteria, viz. Methanosarcina barkeri, until now little information was available about the effect of important environmental factors on the anaerobic fermentation of methanol. As methanol can be the main pollutant in some specific chemical wastes and may be formed under natural conditions (e.g. in marshes) as intermediate in the decomposition of organic matter, more information about the effect of environmental factors is required. In this study the effect of pH, bicarbonate alkalinity and trace elements on the methane fermentation of pure aqueous solutions of methanol has been investigated. Methanol was found to be still fermented at pH values as low as 3.5. The optimal pH range is presumed to lie between pH 5.5 and 6.0. No exact figures can be given yet about the optimal pH range, because pH values higher than 6.0 could not be maintained in a well digesting system (due to the formation of volatile fatty acids (VFA) from methanol), except if no trace element solution was supplied to the influent. In the absence of trace elements the formation of VFA from methanol proceeds fairly slowly, but the conversion of methanol to methane is also slower in that case. In the presence of trace elements a significant fraction, directly depending on the HCO3- concentration, is converted to VFA, mainly consisting of acetic acid and butyric acid. The VFA formation from methanol was found to be more sensitive to a low pH shock (e.g. from pH 3.5 to 4.0) and slows down more rapidly with decreasing pH than the formation of methane. Concerning the anaerobic treatment of wastes containing methanol as the main pollutant, it is not yet possible to decide upon a one-step or a two-step process, e.g. with a separate acid formation and methane fermentation step.},

abstract = {Abstract  Anaerobic digestion represents one of several commercially viable processes to convert woody biomass, agricultural wastes, and municipal solid wastes to methane gas, a useful energy source. This process occurs in the absence of oxygen, and is substantially less energy intensive than aerobic biological processes designed for disposal purposes. The anaerobic conversion process is a result of the synergistic effects of various microorganisms, which serve as a consortium. The rate-limiting step of this conversion process has been identified as the hydrolysis of cellulose, the major polymeric component of most biomass and waste feedstocks. Improvements in process economics therefore rely on improving the kinetic and physicochemical characteristics of cellulose degrading enzymes. The most thoroughly studied cellulase enzymes are produced by aerobic fungi, namelyTrichoderma reesei. However, the pH and temperature optima of fungal cellulases make them incompatible for use in anaerobic digestion systems, and the major populations of microorganisms involved in cellulase enzyme production under anaerobic digestion conditions are various bacterial producers. The current state of understanding of the major groups of bacterial cellulase producers is reviewed in this paper. Also addressed in this review are recently developed methods for the assessment of actual cellulase activity levels, reflective of the digester “hydrolytic potential,” using a series of detergent extractive procedures.},

abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/bit.21528.abs The acidification of mesophilic (30°C) methanol-fed upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactors induced by cobalt deprivation from the influent was investigated by coupling the reactor performance (pH 7.0; organic loading rate 4.5 g COD {\textperiodcentered} L−1 {\textperiodcentered} d−1) to the microbial ecology of the bioreactor sludge. The latter was investigated by specific methanogenic activity (SMA) measurements and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to quantify the abundance of key organisms over time. This study hypothesized that under cobalt limiting conditions, the SMA on methanol of the sludge gradually decreases, which ultimately results in methanol accumulation in the reactor effluent. Once the methanol accumulation surpasses a threshold value (about 8.5 mM for the sludge investigated), reactor acidification occurs because acetogens outcompete methylothrophic methanogens at these elevated methanol concentrations. Methanogens present in granular sludge at the time of the acidification do not use methanol as the direct substrate and are unable to degrade acetate. Methylotrophic/acetoclastic methanogenic activity was found to be lost within 10 days of reactor operation, coinciding with the disappearance of the Methanosarcina population. The loss of SMA on methanol can thus be used as an accurate parameter to predict reactor acidification of methanol-fed UASB reactors operating under cobalt limiting conditions. Biotechnol.

Propionate oxidation did not occur in cocultures with two Methanobrevibacter strains, which grew only with hydrogen. Tricultures consisting of MPOB, one of the Methanobrevibacter strains, and organisms which are able to convert formate into H(2) plus CO(2) (Desulfovibrio strain G11 or the homoacetogenic bacterium EE121) also degraded propionate. The MPOB, in the absence of methanogens, was able to couple propionate conversion to fumarate reduction. This propionate conversion was inhibited by hydrogen and by formate. Formate and hydrogen blocked the energetically unfavorable succinate oxidation to fumarate involved in propionate catabolism. Low formate and hydrogen concentrations are required for the syntrophic degradation of propionate by MPOB. In triculture with Methanospirillum hungatei and the aceticlastic Methanothrix soehngenii, propionate was degraded faster than in biculture with Methanospirillum hungatei, indicating that low acetate concentrations are favorable for propionate oxidation as well.},

When D. desulfuricans or D. vulgaris was grown in the absence of added sulfate in coculture with Methanosarcina barkeri (type strain), which uses both H2-CO2 and acetate for methanogenesis, lactate was stoichiometrically degraded to CH4 and presumably to C02. During the first 12 days of incubation of the D. desulfuricans-M. barkeri coculture, lactate was completely degraded, with almost stoichiometric production of acetate and CH4. Later, acetate was degraded to CH4 and presumably to C02. In experiments in which 20 mM acetate and 0 to 20 mM lactate were added to D. desulfuricans-M. barkeri cocultures, no detectable degradation of acetate occurred until the lactate was catabolized. The ultimate rate of acetate utilization for methanogenesis was greater for those cocultures receiving the highest levels of lactate. A small amount of H2 was detected in cocultures which contained D. desulfuricans and M. barkeri until after all lactate was degraded. The addition of H2, but not of lactate, to the growth medium inhibited acetate degradation by pure cultures of M. barkeri. Pure cultures of M. barkeri produced CH4 from acetate at a rate equivalent to that observed for cocultures containing M. barkeri. Inocula ofM. barkeri grown with H2-CO2 as the methanogenic substrate produced CH4 from acetate at a rate equivalent to that observed for acetate-grown inocula when grown in a rumen fluid-vitamin-based medium but not when grown in a yeast extract-based medium. The results suggest that H2 produced by the Desulfovibrio species during growth with lactate inhibited acetate degradation by M. barkeri.},

abstract = {Intermediates formed during the anaerobic decomposition of propylene glycol under methanogenic conditions were studied using a serum bottle technique. The pathway is similar to the anaerobic decomposition of ethylene glycol as previously reported. For both compounds, the decomposition is believed to proceed via an initial disproportionation of the glycol to form equal molar amounts of the volatile fatty acid and normal alcohol of the same chain length. In the case of ethylene glycol, disproportionation results in the formation of acetate and ethanol, while disproportionation of propylene glycol produces propionate and n-propanol. Following disproportionation, the alcohols produced from glycol fermentation are oxidized to their corresponding volatile fatty acid with the reduction of protons to form hydrogen. Ethanol and propionate oxidation to acetate proceeds via a well-established syntrophic pathway that is favorable only under low hydrogen partial pressures. Subsequent degradation of acetate proceeds via acetoclastic methanogenesis with the production of carbon dioxide and methane. Despite the production of hydrogen in the initial steps of glycol degradation, both compounds are completely degradable under the methanogenic conditions tested in this study.},

Therefore, it was asked here if P. furiosus might be able to adhere also to biotic surfaces. Since Methanopyrus kandleri can be found in habitats similar to those of P. furiosus (seawater close to the boiling point and anaerobic conditions) it was tested if interactions between both archaea occur. Using a standard medium and a gas phase reduced in H2 (compared with the optimal gas phase for M. kandleri) we were able to grow both species in a stable coculture. Very interestingly, M. kandleri could adhere to glass under such conditions, but not P. furiosus. This latter archaeum, however, was able to adhere onto M. kandleri cells and onto itself, resulting in structured biofilms on glass. These very often appeared as a bottom layer of M. kandleri cells covered by a multitude of P. furiosus cells. Interactions between P. furiosus and M. kandleri were mediated not only by flagella, but also by direct cell-cell contact.},

The antagonistic effect of calcium chloride is caused by precipitation of the inhibitory long-chain fatty acids as calcium salts.

abstract = {A new method for online measurement of volatile fatty acids (VFA) in anerobic digesters has been developed based on headspace gas chromatography (HSGC). The method applies ex situ VFA stripping with variable headspace volume and gas analysis by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID). In each extraction, digester sample was acidified with H3PO4 and NaHSO4, then heated to strip the VFA into the gas phase. The gas was sampled in a low friction glass syringe before injected into the GC for measurement. The system has been tested for online monitoring of a lab-scale CSTR reactor treating manure for more than 6 months and has shown good agreement with off-line analysis. The system is capable of measuring individual VFA components. This is of advantage since specific VFA components such as propionic and butyric acid can give extra information about the process status. Another important advantage of this sensor is that there is no filtration, which makes possible application in high solids environments. The system can thus be easily applied in a full-scale biogas reactor by connecting the system to the liquid circulation loop to obtain fresh sample from the reactor. Local calibration is needed but automatic calibration is also possible using standard addition method. Sampling duration is 25-40 min, depending on the washing duration, and sensor response is 10 min. This is appropriate for full-scale reactors, since dynamics within most biogas reactors are of the order of several hours. Biotechnol.

Each digester was fed with an influent, composed of OMW and OMSW, at an organic loading rate (OLR) varying between 0.67 and 6.67 g COD/l/d. The hydraulic retention times (HRT) were 12, 24 and 36 days.

The results indicated that the best methane production was about 0.95 l/l/day obtained at an OLR = 4.67 g COD/l/d, corresponding to influent TCOD = 56 g COD/l at an HRT = 12d. In contrast, the maximum TCOD removal efficiency (89{\%}) was achieved at an OLR = 0.67 g COD/l/d, corresponding to influent TCOD = 24 g COD/l at an HRT = 36 d.

abstract = {Among methanogens, only 2 genera, Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina, are known to contribute to methanogenesis from acetate, and Methanosaeta is a specialist that uses acetate specifically. However, Methanosaeta strains so far have mainly been isolated from anaerobic digesters, despite the fact that it is widespread, not only in anaerobic methanogenic reactors and freshwater environments, but also in marine environments, based upon extensive 16S rRNA gene-cloning analyses. In this study, we isolated an aceticlastic methanogen, designated strain 03d30q(T), from a tidal flat sediment. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and mcrA genes revealed that the isolate belongs to the genus Methanosaeta. Unlike the other known Methanosaeta species, this isolate grows at Na(+) concentrations of 0.20 to 0.80 M, with an optimum concentration of 0.28 M. Quantitative estimation using real-time PCR detected the 16S rRNA gene of the genus Methanosaeta in the marine sediment, and relative abundance ranged from 3.9{\%} to 11.8{\%} of the total archaeal 16S rRNA genes. In addition, the number of Methanosaeta organisms increased with increasing depth and was much higher than that of Methanosarcina organisms, suggesting that aceticlastic methanogens contribute to acetate metabolism to a greater extent than previously thought in marine environments, where sulfate-reducing acetate oxidation prevails. This is the first report on marine Methanosaeta species, and based on phylogenetic and characteristic studies, the name "Methanosaeta pelagica" sp. nov. is proposed for this novel species, with type strain 03d30q.},

abstract = {Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have gained a lot of attention in recent years as a mode of converting organic waste including low-strength wastewaters and lignocellulosic biomass into electricity. Microbial production of electricity may become an important form of bioenergy in future because MFCs offer the possibility of extracting electric current from a wide range of soluble or dissolved complex organic wastes and renewable biomass. A large number of substrates have been explored as feed. The major substrates that have been tried include various kinds of artificial and real wastewaters and lignocellulosic biomass. Though the current and power yields are relatively low at present, it is expected that with improvements in technology and knowledge about these unique systems, the amount of electric current (and electric power) which can be extracted from these systems will increase tremendously providing a sustainable way of directly converting lignocellulosic biomass or wastewaters to useful energy. This article reviews the various substrates that have been explored in MFCs so far, their resulting performance, limitations as well as future potential substrates.},

In this study we have investigated, on a laboratory scale, the anaerobic co-digestion of olive mill wastewater (OMW) with olive mill solid waste (OMSW) using semi-continuous, feeding, tubular digesters operated at mesophilic temperatures. Each digester was fed with an influent, composed of OMW and OMSW, at an organic loading rate (OLR) varying between 0.67 and 6.67 g COD/l/d. The hydraulic retention times (HRT) were 12, 24 and 36 days. The TCOD concentrations of OMW used as the main substrate were 24, 56 and 80 g COD/l; the amount of the dry OMSW used as a co-substrate was fixed to approximately 56 g/l of OMW. The results indicated that the best methane production was about 0.95 l/l/day obtained at an OLR = 4.67 g COD/l/d, corresponding to influent TCOD = 56 g COD/l at an HRT = 12d. In contrast, the maximum TCOD removal efficiency (89{\%}) was achieved at an OLR = 0.67 g COD/l/d, corresponding to influent TCOD = 24 g COD/l at an HRT = 36 d. Moreover, the inhibition of biogas production was observed at the highest OLR studied.},

abstract = {Nitrogen assimilation in the methanogenic archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis is regulated by transcriptional repression involving a palindromic 'nitrogen operator' repressor binding sequence. Here we report the isolation of the nitrogen repressor, NrpR, from M. maripaludis using DNA affinity purification. Deletion of the nrpR gene resulted in loss of nitrogen operator binding activity in cell extracts and loss of repression of nif (nitrogen-fixation) and glnA (glutamine synthetase) gene expression in vivo. Genetic complementation of the nrpR mutation restored all functions. NrpR contained a putative N-terminal winged helix-turn-helix motif followed by two mutually homologous domains of unknown function. Comparison of the migration of NrpR in gel-filtration chromatography with its subunit molecular weight (60 kDa) suggested that NrpR was a tetramer. Several lines of evidence suggested that the level of NrpR itself is not regulated, and the binding affinity of NrpR to the nitrogen operator is controlled by an unknown mechanism. Homologues of NrpR were found only in certain species in the kingdom Euryarchaeota. Full length homologues were found in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus, and homologues lacking one or more of the three polypeptide domains were found in Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanopyrus kandleri, Methanosarcina acetivorans, and Methanosarcina mazei. NrpR represents a new family of regulators unique to the Euryarchaeota.},

abstract = {The results of two objective and quantitative, computer-assisted analyses of the lipid component parts distribution pattern among various archaeal organisms belonging to Euryarchaeota are reported. One was a cluster analysis and the other a selection of unique combinations of lipid component parts found exclusively in a given taxon. The cluster analysis revealed that the distribution of lipid component parts was correlated with phylogeny based on small subunit rRNA sequences, although there was some discrepancy with rRNA phylogeny. A hypothesis that may explain the reason for the correlation and the discrepancy is proposed. In our scenario, we assumed that random and independent mutations on the rRNA and lipid biosynthesis genes may result largely in coincided evolution. The fact that RNA and lipid are semantide and episemantic molecules, respectively, is the fundamental difference between the phylogeny of RNA and lipid. Moreover, different selective pressures on RNA and lipids exert different effects on their evolution. Unique lipid component parts were detected for eight out of nine orders, 14 families, and 22 genera of the Euryarchaeota analyzed. A unique lipid component parts combination pattern characterized the taxon. The results confirm and extend a previously reported conclusion based on a more statistical basis.},

abstract = {The performance of a two-stage, two-phase, unmixed anaerobic digester of 155 l working volume operating on acid cheese whey and dairy manure at various temperatures and hydraulic retention times was investigated. The effect of controlling the pH of the methanogonic stage of cheese whey digestion on the biogas production rate and pollution potential reduction was also investigated. The digester was designed to act as a liquid-solid separator, in order to maximize the microbial mass in the reactor, and was operated at three hydraulic retention times (10, 15 and 20 days) and two temperatures (25 and 35°C). It operated as a single-phase reactor under both the cheese whey and dairy manure feeding conditions when the pH was not controlled (similar pH values in the inlet and outlet chambers) and as a two-stage, two-phase reactor when the pH of the whey was controlled in the methanogenic stage (different pH values in the inlet and outlet chambers). The results indicated that production of biogas from cheese whey without pH control is not feasible as the digester experienced acid-phase digestion in both stages. However, controlling the pH of the methanogenic stage increased the biogas production rate and methane yield, as well as the reductions in COD and solids concentrations of the cheese whey by a factor of 2.7-3.0. Although the pH was maintained at 5.7-6.0, the results are comparable to those obtained with dairy manure of a similar solids concentration and a pH of 7 ± 0.2. A further increase in the pH (to 7.0 ± 0.2) would, therefore, increase the biogas production rate and methane yield from cheese whey.},

It has been proposed, on the basis of geochemical and thermodynamic considerations, that geologically derived hydrogen might support subsurface microbial communities on Mars and Europa in which methanogens form the base of the ecosystem. Here we describe a unique subsurface microbial community in which hydrogen-consuming, methane-producing Archaea far outnumber the Bacteria. More than 90{\%} of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequences recovered from hydrothermal waters circulating through deeply buried igneous rocks in Idaho are related to hydrogen-using methanogenic microorganisms. Geochemical characterization indicates that geothermal hydrogen, not organic carbon, is the primary energy source for this methanogen-dominated microbial community. These results demonstrate that hydrogen-based methanogenic communities do occur in Earth's subsurface, providing an analogue for possible subsurface microbial ecosystems on other planets.},

abstract = {A set of oligonucleotide primers capable of initiating enzymatic amplification (polymerase chain reaction) on a phylogenetically and taxonomically wide range of bacteria is described along with methods for their use and examples. One pair of primers is capable of amplifying nearly full-length 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) from many bacterial genera; the additional primers are useful for various exceptional sequences. Methods for purification of amplified material, direct sequencing, cloning, sequencing, and transcription are outlined. An obligate intracellular parasite of bovine erythrocytes, Anaplasma marginale, is used as an example; its 16S rDNA was amplified, cloned, sequenced, and phylogenetically placed. Anaplasmas are related to the genera Rickettsia and Ehrlichia. In addition, 16S rDNAs from several species were readily amplified from material found in lyophilized ampoules from the American Type Culture Collection. By use of this method, the phylogenetic study of extremely fastidious or highly pathogenic bacterial species can be carried out without the need to culture them. In theory, any gene segment for which polymerase chain reaction primer design is possible can be derived from a readily obtainable lyophilized bacterial culture.},

abstract = {The performance of a two-stage, two-phase, unmixed anaerobic digester of 155 l working volume operating on acid cheese whey and dairy manure at various temperatures and hydraulic retention times was investigated. The effect of controlling the pH of the methanogonic stage of cheese whey digestion on the biogas production rate and pollution potential reduction was also investigated. The digester was designed to act as a liquid-solid separator, in order to maximize the microbial mass in the reactor, and was operated at three hydraulic retention times (10, 15 and 20 days) and two temperatures (25 and 35°C). It operated as a single-phase reactor under both the cheese whey and dairy manure feeding conditions when the pH was not controlled (similar pH values in the inlet and outlet chambers) and as a two-stage, two-phase reactor when the pH of the whey was controlled in the methanogenic stage (different pH values in the inlet and outlet chambers). The results indicated that production of biogas from cheese whey without pH control is not feasible as the digester experienced acid-phase digestion in both stages. However, controlling the pH of the methanogenic stage increased the biogas production rate and methane yield, as well as the reductions in COD and solids concentrations of the cheese whey by a factor of 2.7-3.0. Although the pH was maintained at 5.7-6.0, the results are comparable to those obtained with dairy manure of a similar solids concentration and a pH of 7 ± 0.2. A further increase in the pH (to 7.0 ± 0.2) would, therefore, increase the biogas production rate and methane yield from cheese whey.},

abstract = {Summary
A methylotrophic, methanogenic bacterium was isolated from the anoxic hypolimnion of Ace Lake, Antarctica, a lake with ionic composition similar to that of seawater. The new isolate utilized methanol in addition to methylamines but not H2:CO2, formate or acetate. The optimum and maximum temperatures for growth were 23.4 and 29.5 °C respectively. The strain grew in artificial media at in situ lake temperature (1.7°C), provided growth was first initiated in the media at higher temperatures. The strain had a theoretical minimum temperature for growth of -2.5 °C. The mol{\%} G+C content of DNA from the strain was 39.6{\%} (Tm). The phenotype, polar lipid pattern, antigenic fingerprint and 16S rRNA sequence of the strain were most similar to, but distinct from Methanococcoides methylutens. DNA/DNA homology was low between the Ace Lake methanogen and Methanococcoides methylutens (27.5{\%}). A new species Methanococcoides burtonii is described and the type strain is DSM 6242.},

abstract = {We develop a kinetic model that builds on the foundation of classic Monod kinetics, but incorporates new phenomena such as substrate thresholds and survival mode observed in experiments with the H2-oxidizing methanogen Methanobacterium bryantii M.o.H. We apply our model to the experimental data presented in our companion paper on H2 thresholds. The model accurately describes H2 consumption, CH4 generation, biomass growth, substrate thresholds, and survival state during batch experiments. Methane formation stops when its Gibbs free energy is equal zero, although this does not interrupt H2 oxidation. The thermodynamic threshold for H2 oxidation occurs when the free energy for oxidizing H2 and transferring electrons to biomass is no longer negative, at approximately 0.4 nM. This threshold is not controlled by the Gibbs free energy equation of methanogenesis from H2 + HCO3- as we show in our companion paper. Beyond this threshold, the microorganisms shift to a low-maintenance metabolism called "the survival state" in response to extended H2 starvation; adding the starvation response as another new feature of the kinetic model. A kinetic threshold (or S (min)), a natural feature of the Monod kinetics, is also captured by the model at H2 concentration of around approximately 2,400 nM. S (min) is the minimum substrate concentration to maintain steady-state biomass concentration. Our model will be useful for interpreting threshold results and designing new studies to understand thresholds and their ecological implications.},

By comparing the growth of M. mobile with boiled cell extract with that observed with various methanogenic cofactors, we found that 7-mercaptoheptanoylthreonine phosphate (HS-HTP) supported sustained growth of M. mobile, at an optimal concentration of 100 microM. No derivatives or possible biosynthetic precursors of HS-HTP could replace HS-HTP as the sole source of growth factor. Results suggest that the growth requirement might be satisfied by 7-mercaptoheptanoic acid plus a second, unidentified heat-stable factor.},

abstract = {A morphologically distinct, filamentous methan- ogen was isolated from hindguts of the subterranean ter- mite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) (Rhinotermitidae), wherein it was part of the microbiota colonizing the hindgut wall. Individual filaments of strain RFM-3 were 0.23–0.28 µm in diameter and usually {\textgreater} 50 µm in length and aggregated into flocs that were often ≥ 0.1 mm in di- ameter. Optimal growth of strain RFM-3 was obtained at pH 7.0–7.2 and 30°C with a yeast-extract-supplemented, dithiothreitol-reduced medium in which cells produced stoichiometric amounts of methane from H2 + CO2. The morphology and gram-positive staining reaction of strain RFM-3, as well as its resistance to cell lysis by various chemical agents and its restriction to H2 + CO2 as an en- ergy source, suggested that it was a member of the Me- thanobacteriaceae. The nucleotide sequence of the SSU- rRNA-encoding gene of strain RFM-3 confirmed this af- filiation and also supported its recognition as a new species of Methanobrevibacter, for which the epithet filiformis is herewith proposed. Although M. filiformis was one of the dominant methanogens in R. flavipes collected from Woods Hole (Mass., USA), cells of similar morphology were not consistently observed in R. flavipes collected from differ- ent geographical locations.

The cells were non-motile, Gram-negative and rod-shaped (1.8-2.4 microm long by 0.3-0.6 microm wide). Growth of strain SANAET was observed at 25-40 degrees C, with an optimum temperature range for growth of 35-37 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 6.5-7.8, with an optimum at pH 7.0. The salinity range for growth was 0-1 g NaCl l(-1) (0-17 mM). The isolate was able to utilize H2/CO2 and formate for growth and methane production. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.6 mol{\%}. Based on comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain SANAET was affiliated with a clone lineage of the Archaea, Rice Cluster I (RC-I), placing it between the orders Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales within the class 'Methanomicrobia'. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain SANAET and members of Methanosarcinales were in the range 80.0-82.8 {\%}, and those between the strain and members of Methanomicrobiales ranged from 77.5 to 82.4 {\%}. In addition to 16S rRNA gene analysis, sequence analysis of the mcrA gene (encoding the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, a key enzyme in the methane production pathway) also showed that strain SANAET was affiliated with the RC-I lineage. Here, we propose the name Methanocella paludicola gen. nov., sp. nov. for the isolate, the first of the RC-I lineage. The type strain is SANAET (=JCM 13418T=NBRC 101707T=DSM 17711T). In addition, we also propose the status of order for the RC-I lineage, for which we propose the name Methanocellales ord. nov.},

Cells were non-motile rods, 1.3-2.8 $\mu$m long and 0.4-0.7 $\mu$m wide. Coccoid cells were also observed in cultures at the late-exponential phase of growth. Strain MRE50(T) grew at 37-55 °C (optimally at 45 °C), at pH 6-7.8 (optimally at pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0-20 g NaCl l(-1). The isolate utilized H(2)/CO(2) and formate for growth and methane production. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene and the methanogen-specific marker gene mcrA showed that strain MRE50(T) is affiliated with the order Methanocellales, previously known as uncultured archaeal group Rice Cluster I. Based on both 16S rRNA gene and mcrA gene sequences, strain MRE50(T) was related most closely to Methanocella paludicola SANAE(T). Levels of sequence similarity were 92.5 and 86.1 {\%}, respectively, indicating that strains MRE50(T) and Methanocella paludicola SANAE(T) represent different species within the genus Methanocella. In addition, although these strains shared phenotypic properties including cell morphology and substrate utilization, they differed with respect to susceptibility to antibiotics, and temperature and NaCl ranges for growth. Given the phenotypic differences and the distinct phylogenetic placement of the new isolate relative to the type species of the genus Methanocella, strain MRE50(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Methanocella, for which the name Methanocella arvoryzae sp. nov. is proposed.
