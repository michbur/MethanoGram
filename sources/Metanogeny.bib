Two groups (moderately halophilic Methanohalophilus strains and extremely halophilic Methanohalobium strains) were formed on the basis of G+ C contents and DNA-DNA hybridization data. Type strain SLP of Methanohalophilus mahii and type strain 2-7982 of Methanococcus halophilus exhibited 87{\%} sequence similarity and belong to the same genus (Methanohalophilus), if not to the same species. A regulation of the International Code of Nomenclature of BacteriQ implies that the specific epithet halophilus has priority by validation and should be retained. Therefore, we propose that Methanococcus halophilus should be transferred to the genus Methanohalophilus as Methanohalophilus halophilus comb. nov. (type strain, strain 2-7982 [= DSM 3094 = OCM 1601); an emended description is given. Moderately halophilic strains TR-7, 2-7404, and 2-7405, which were isolated from geographically separated sites, exhibited high levels of DNA-DNA hybridization with Methanohalophilus mahii and might be regarded as strains of the same Methanohalophilus species. The alkaliphilic organism Methanohalophilus zhilinae is a valid species in the genus Methanohalophilus. The extremely halophilic organism Methanohalobium evestigatum exhibited no significant DNA-DN A hybridization with moderately halophilic species and should be regarded as a member of an independent genus. Other extremely halophilic strains (strains 2-7408 and 2-7403) exhibited low levels of DNA-DNA hybridization with Methanohalobium evestigatum Z-7303T (= DSM 3721) (T = type strain).},

Cells were wavy rods (11-62 $\mu$m long) with blunt tapered ends and Gram-negative stained. Strain X-18T grew strict anaerobically and produced methane exclusively from H2/CO2. Growth occurred in the temperature range of 4-32 °C and optimally at 25 °C. Growth pH ranged from 6.5-8.0 and optimally at 7.0. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain X-18T was 44.4 mol{\%}. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase indicated that strain X-18T affiliated to the genus Methanospirillium, and was most related to Methanospirillum lacunae Ki8-1T at 96.3{\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. However, strain X-18T was distinguished from the existing Methanospirillium spp. by the lower growth temperature and obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic analysis, strain X-18T can represent a novel species of the genus Methanospirillum, for which Methanospirillum psychrodurum sp. nov. is proposed and strain X-18T is assigned as the type strain (=CGMCC 1.5186T=JCM 19216T).},

abstract = {Nitrogen fixation (diazotrophy) has recently been demonstrated in several methanogenic archaebacteria. To compare the process in an archaebacterium with that in eubacteria, we examined the properties of diazotrophic growth and nitrogenase activity in Methanosarcina barkeri 227. Growth yields with methanol or acetate as a growth substrate were significantly lower in N(2)-grown cultures than in NH(4)-grown cultures, and the culture doubling times were increased, indicating that diazotrophy was energetically costly, as it is in eubacteria. Growth of nitrogen-fixing cells was inhibited when molybdenum was omitted from the medium; addition of 10 nM molybdate stimulated growth, while 1 muM molybdate restored maximum diazotrophic growth. Omission of molybdenum did not inhibit growth of ammonia-grown cells. Tungstate (100 muM) strongly inhibited growth of molybdenum-deficient diazotrophic cells, while ammonia-grown cells were unaffected. The addition of 100 nM vanadate or chromate did not stimulate diazotrophic growth of molybdenum-starved cells. These results are consistent with the presence of a molybdenum-containing nitrogenase in M. barkeri. Acetylene, the usual substrate for assaying nitrogenase activity, inhibited methanogenesis by M. barkeri and consequently needed to be used at a low partial pressure (0.3{\%} of the headspace) when acetylene reduction by whole cells was assayed. Whole cells reduced 0.3{\%} acetylene to ethylene at a very low rate (1 to 2 nmol h mg of protein), and they "switched off" acetylene reduction in response to added ammonia or glutamine. Crude extracts from diazotrophic cells reduced 10{\%} acetylene at a rate of 4 to 5 nmol of C(2)H(4) formed h mg of protein when supplied with ATP and reducing power, while extracts of Klebsiella pneumoniae prepared by the same procedures had rates 100-fold higher. Acetylene reduction by extracts required ATP and was completely inhibited by 1 mM ADP in the presence of 5 mM ATP. The low rates of C(2)H(2) reduction could be due to improper assay conditions, to switched-off enzyme, or to the nitrogenase's having lower activity towards acetylene than towards dinitrogen.},

It allowed much larger numbers of colonies to be counted and isolated with greater ease from a given volume of medium and after longer incubation periods. The main modifications made were the use of rumen fluid clarified by centrifugation, reducing the concentration of the sugar energy sources (glucose and cellobiose) and inclusion of soluble starch as an additional energy source, and changing the reducing agent from cysteine to a combination of cysteine and sodium sulfide. Many other modifications in the medium were tested and found to be without effect or detrimental to colony counts. Experiments indicate that about the same range of species of bacteria are cultured in the improved medium as in the old, except that the improved medium allows the growth of bacteroides strains that utilize starch but not glucose or cellobiose. Significant differences were shown in nonselective viable counts of ruminal bacteria obtained from samples of rumen contents collected at different times during the day from a cow fed alfalfa hay or a grain mixture once a day, and there were also differences in counts due to the ration},

abstract = {Populations of the four major trophic groups of methanogens were enumerated by most probable numbers (MPN) on selective media in a sample of 13 soils representative of major types of rice soils. Dominant strains were isolated and their phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics were studied. MPN counts ranged from 102 to 106 g-1 d.w. on H2, from {\textless} 10 to 104 g-1 d.w. on acetate, from {\textless}10 to 105 on methanol, and from 50 to 106 on formate. In most soils, counts of hydrogenotrophs were higher than counts of acetotrophs, partly because acetotrophs were aggregated sarcinae difficult to separate into individual cells. Methylotrophs other than acetotrophic sarcinae were not recorded. In most soils, rods enumerated on formate were 5-400 times less abundant than those enumerated on H2, indicating that hydrogenotrophic-non-formatotrophic rods are probably dominant in ricefields. Dominant strains isolated comprised: 15 hydrogenotrophic-non-formatotrophic rods affiliated to Methanobacterium bryantii; three hydrogenotrophic-formatotrophic rods affiliated to Mb. formicicum; one hydrogenotrophic-formatotrophic rod not affiliated to a sequenced species; two sarcinae affiliated so far isolated from marine sediments only. Results from classical counts of methanogens and strains isolated from ricefields suggest the dominance of Methanobacterium spp. (mostly responsible for CH4 production from H2/CO2) and Methanosarcina spp. (mostly responsible for CH4 production from acetate) among culturable organisms. Both genera are probably ubiquitous. In particular, Mb. bryantii was isolated fro 12 of the 13 soils.},

The methanogens were selectively isolated as colonies on agar petri dishes that were incubated in a novel container. The general cellular and growth features of three Methanobacterium isolates were determined. These strains grew optimally at 37 to 45 degrees C in anaerobic pressure tube cultures with a doubling time of 16 to 18 h on H(2)-CO(2) and proliferated as autotrophs. Acetate addition significantly enhanced the final cell yield. Growth of these strains was completely inhibited by either 0.6 g of sodium sulfide per liter or 31.0 of sodium chloride per liter, but growth was not inhibited by either 0.3 g of sodium sulfide per liter or 1.0 g of sodium sulfate per liter. One novel isolate, Methanobacterium sp. strain ivanov, was grown on H(2)-CO(2), and the stable-carbon isotopic fractionations that occurred during synthesis of methane, cell carbon, and lipids were determined. The results of this study were used to examine the anomalous relationship between the isotopic and chemical compositions of natural gas occurring in the deep subsurface environment of the oil field.},

abstract = {A novel methanogenic archaeon, strain MC-15(T), was isolated from a floating biofilm on a sulphurous subsurface lake in Movile Cave (Mangalia, Romania). Cells were non-motile sarcina-like cocci with a diameter of 2-4 µm, occurring in aggregates. The strain was able to grow autotrophically on H2/CO2. Additionally, acetate, methanol, monomethylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine were utilized, but not formate or dimethyl sulfide. Trypticase peptone and yeast extract were not required for growth. Optimal growth was observed at 33 °C, pH 6.5 and a salt concentration of 0.05 M NaCl. The predominant membrane lipids of MC-15(T) were archaeol and hydroxyarchaeol phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol as well as hydroxyarchaeol phosphatidylserine and archaeol glycosaminyl phosphatidylinositol. The closely related species, Methanosarcina vacuolata and Methanosarcina horonobensis, had a similar composition of major membrane lipids to strain MC-15(T). The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain MC-15(T) was similar to those of Methanosarcina vacuolata DSM 1232(T) (sequence similarity 99.3{\%}), Methanosarcina horonobensis HB-1(T) (98.8{\%}), Methanosarcina barkeri DSM 800(T) (98.7{\%}) and Methanosarcina siciliae T4/M(T) (98.4{\%}). DNA-DNA hybridization revealed 43.3{\%} relatedness between strain MC-15(T) and Methanosarcina vacuolata DSM 1232(T). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 39.0 mol{\%}. Based on physiological, phenotypic and genotypic differences, strain MC-15(T) represents a novel species of the genus Methanosarcina, for which the name Methanosarcina spelaei sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MC-15(T) ( = DSM 26047(T) = JCM 18469(T)).},

Cells were irregular, monopolar monotrichous flagellated cocci 1.5-3 microm in diameter often occurring in pairs or tetrads. The catabolic substrates used included methanol, methylated amines, and acetate, but not formate or H2/CO2. Growth was observed in a temperature range between 4 degrees and 27 degrees C with an optimum at 25 degrees C. The doubling time with methanol as substrate was 84 h at 25 degrees C, 120 h at 9 degrees C, and 167 h at 4 degrees C. The doubling time with acetate as substrate was 252 h at 25 degrees C and 425 h at 20 degrees C. After the transfer of methanol-grown cultures, long lag phases were observed that lasted 15-20 days at 25 degrees C and 25 days at 4 degrees -9 degrees C. The NaCl optimum for growth was 2{\%}-4{\%}, and the fastest growth occurred within a pH range of 6.5-7.5.

abstract = {A thermophilic strain of Methanosarcina, designated Methanosarcina strain TM-1, was isolated from a laboratory-scale 55 degrees C anaerobic sludge digestor by the Hungate roll-tube technique. Penicillin and d-cycloserine, inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis, were used as selective agents to eliminate contaminating non-methanogens. Methanosarcina strain TM-1 had a temperature optimum for methanogenesis near 50 degrees C and grew at 55 degrees C but not at 60 degrees C. Substrates used for methanogenesis and growth by Methanosarcina strain TM-1 were acetate (12-h doubling time), methanol (7- to 10-h doubling time), methanol-acetate mixtures (5-h doubling time), methylamine, and trimethylamine. When radioactively labeled acetate was the sole methanogenic substrate added to the growth medium, it was predominantly split to methane and carbon dioxide. When methanol was also present in the medium, the metabolism of acetate shifted to its oxidation and incorporation into cell material. Electrons derived from acetate oxidation apparently were used to reduce methanol. H(2)-CO(2) was not used for growth and methanogenesis by Methanosarcina strain TM-1. When presented with both H(2)-CO(2) and methanol, Methanosarcina strain TM-1 was capable of limited hydrogen metabolism during growth on methanol, but hydrogen metabolism ceased once the methanol was depleted. Methanosarcina strain TM-1 required a growth factor (or growth factors) present in the supernatant of anaerobic digestor sludge. Growth factor requirements and the inability to use H(2)-CO(2) are characteristics not found in other described Methanosarcina strains. The high numbers of Methanosarcina-like clumps in sludges from thermophilic digestors and the fast generation times reported here for Methanosarcina TM-1 indicate that Methanosarcina may play an important role in thermophilic methanogenesis.},

@article{Jetten1992,
abstract = {Acetate is the precursor of approximately two-thirds of the methane produced in anaerobic bioreactors. Only two genera of methanogenic archae are known to use acetate as sole energy source: Methanosarcina and Methanothrix. Methanosarcina appears to be a generalist with a high growth rate, but low affinity for acetate. Methanothrix is a specialist having a high affinity for acetate, but low growth rate. Methanothrix shows a much lower minimum threshold for acetate utilization (7–70 $\mu$M) than Methanosarcina (0.2–1.2 mM). This is consistent with the evidence that Methanothrix is found in environments with low acetate concentrations. The acetate degradation by acetotrophic methanogens starts with an activation of acetate to acetyl-coenzyme A. In Methanosarcina spp. this activation is catalysed by an acetate kinase/phosphotransacetylase system at the expense of one ATP. Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase activates acetate in Methanothrix, with concomitant hydrolysis of one ATP to AMP and PPi. Both enzyme systems have been purified and comparison of the kinetic properties confirmed the hypothesis that low acetate concentrations favour Methanothrix. The gene encoding for acetyl-CoA synthetase of Methanothrix was isolated from a genomic library and actively expressed in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence showed homology to proteins with similar function and contained two putative ATP binding sites. The most characteristic and complex enzyme involved in the acetate degradation by acetotrophic methanogens is carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. The enzyme has been purified from both Methanothrix and Methanosarcina, and represents 5–10{\%} of the soluble protein of these microorganisms. CO dehydrogenase is proposed to catalyse both the cleavage of acetyl-CoA in a methyl-, carbonyl- and CoA-moiety, and the oxidation of the carbonyl group to CO2. This multifunctional redox enzyme contains several iron, acid-labile sulfur and nickel atoms. These atoms are arranged into several paramagnetic complexes, which have been studied by EPR spectroscopy. The low spin recovery of the different paramagnetic centers makes statements about structure and functions difficult. There are good spectroscopic and genetic indications that the CO dehydrogenase of Methanothrix contains at least one ferrodoxin-like [4Fe-4S] cluster, which could play a role in the electron transfer of the CO oxidation. Further, in EPR spectra of concentrated samples of CO dehydrogenase from Methanothrix a very unusual signal was observed, which showed great similarity to putative [6Fe-6S] prismane clusters. The final step in the methanogenesis from acetate, the reduction of methyl-coenzyme M, is catalysed by methyl-coenzyme M methylreductase. The enzyme purified from Methanothrix and Methanosarcina showed great homology with the methyl-CoM methylreductase of other methanogenic archae, although the specific activity was rather low (60–125 nmol min−1 mg−1). The reduction of the heterodisulfide between coenzyme M and component B is proposed to be the common site for energy conservation in all methanogens. Acetoclastic methanogens, however, need additional sites of energy conservation to compensate for their high energy input in acetate activation. The oxidation of CO to CO2 could form one possible site. The partially membrane-associated pyrophosphatase of Methanothrix could form another site of energy conservation.},

A habitat-simulating medium with H2:CO2 as substrate was used for enrichment and isolation. The methanogen is strictly anaerobic, weakly-motile, non-sporeforming, Gram negative, and a pleomorphic coccoid-rod averaging 1.2 by 1.6 $\mu$m. Colonies are circular, translucent, pale yellow, and have a smooth surface and an entire edge. The organism is a mesophile, growing between 18 and 47°C, with an optimum near 38°C. The pH optimum for growth is 6.8–7.2, and only formate or a mixture of H2 plus CO2 serve as substrates. Seawater (20–70{\%} v/v) is required, but it can be replaced by 15 mM, or greater, magnesium. Optimal growth occurs with 110 mM sodium. Growth rate is stimulated by selenium (10 $\mu$M) but organic compounds (acetate, vitamins, amino acids) are neither stimulatory nor required. The methanogen grows well in autotrophic medium with a doubling time of about 2h. Cells are fragile, are lysed by aqueous solutions of low osmolality and by detergents, and the lack muramic acid. The cell wall is a single electron dense layer. The DNA base composition is 33 mol {\%} guanine plus cytosine. Antigenic relationship of cells and the 16S ribosomal RNA catalog indicate that the salt marsh methanogen is a unique species of Methanococcus, for which we propose the name Methanococcus maripaludis sp. nov.},

@article{Takai2008,
abstract = {We have developed a technique for cultivation of chemolithoautotrophs under high hydrostatic pressures that is successfully applicable to various types of deep-sea chemolithoautotrophs, including methanogens. It is based on a glass-syringe-sealing liquid medium and gas mixture used in conjunction with a butyl rubber piston and a metallic needle stuck into butyl rubber. By using this technique, growth, survival, and methane production of a newly isolated, hyperthermophilic methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri strain 116 are characterized under high temperatures and hydrostatic pressures. Elevated hydrostatic pressures extend the temperature maximum for possible cell proliferation from 116°C at 0.4 MPa to 122°C at 20 MPa, providing the potential for growth even at 122°C under an in situ high pressure. In addition, piezophilic growth significantly affected stable carbon isotope fractionation of methanogenesis from CO2. Under conventional growth conditions, the isotope fractionation of methanogenesis by M. kandleri strain 116 was similar to values (−34‰ to−27‰) previously reported for other hydrogenotrophic methanogens. However, under high hydrostatic pressures, the isotope fractionation effect became much smaller ({\textless}−12‰), and the kinetic isotope effect at 122°C and 40 MPa was −9.4‰, which is one of the smallest effects ever reported. This observation will shed light on the sources and production mechanisms of deep-sea methane.},

The grew between 84 and 110°C (opt: 98°C) and from 0.2{\%} to 4{\%} NaCl (opt. 2{\%}) and pH 5.5 to 7 (opt: 6.5). The isolates were obligate chemolithoautotrophes using H2/CO2 as energy and carbon sources. In the presence of sulfur, H2S was formed and cells tended to lyse. The cell wall consisted of a new type of pseudomurein containing ornithin in addition to lysine and no N-acetylglucosamine. The pseudomurein layer was covered by a detergent-sensitive protein surface layer. The core lipid consisted exclusively of phytanyl diether. The GC content of the DNA was 60 mol{\%}. By 16S rRNA comparisons the new organisms were not related to any of the three methanogenic lineages. Based on the physiological and molecular properties of the new isolates, we describe here a new genus, which we name Methanopyrus (the “methane fire”). The type species is Methanopyrus kandleri (type strain: AV19; DSM 6324).},

abstract = {An autotrophic, hyperthermophilic methanogen (M7T) was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal chimney sample collected on the East Pacific Rise at depth of 2600 m. The coccoid-shaped cells are flagellated and exhibit a sligh tumbling motility. The temperature range for growth at pH 6.5 was 49--89 °C, with optimum growth at 80 °C. The optimum pH for growth was 6.5, and the optimum NaCI concentration for growth was around 25 g I-1. The new isolat used H2 and CO2 as the only substrates for growth and methane production. Tungsten, selenium and yeast extract stimulated growth significantly. In the presence of C02 and H2 the organism reduced elemental sulphur to hydrogen sulphide. Growth was inhibited by chloramphenicol and rifampicin, but not by ampicillin, kanamycin, penicillin and streptomycin. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 31 mol{\%}. As determined by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, this organism was closely related to Methanococcus jannaschii strain JAL-1T. However, despite the high percentage of similarity between their 16S rDNA sequences (97.1 {\%}), the DNA-DNA hybridization levels between these strains were less than 5{\%}. On the basis of these observations and physiological traits, it is proposed that this organism should be placed in a new species, Methanococcus vulcanius. The type strain is M7T(= DSM 12094T) During the course of this study, the 16S rDNA sequence analysis placed Methanococcus sp. strain AG86T(= DSM 4213T) as a close relative of M. jannaschii strain JAL-1T. However, the weak level of DNA-DNA hybridization with this strain ({\textless} 10{\%}) allowed the proposal that strain AG86Talso constitutes a new species, Methanococcus fervens.},

The strain was strictly anaerobic, and cells were curved rods, 0.4–0.5×7.5–25 µm, that sometimes formed wavy filaments from 25 to several hundred micrometres in length. Cells stained Gram-negative and were non-sporulating. They were gently motile by means of tufted flagella. The strain grew at 5–37 °C (optimum at 20–30 °C), at pH 6.0–10 (optimum 7.0–7.5) and with 0–0.3 M NaCl (optimum 0 M NaCl). Growth and methane production was found with H2/CO2 and very weak growth with formate. Acetate and yeast extract stimulated growth, but were not essential. The G+C content of the DNA of strain Pt1 was 40 mol{\%}. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain Pt1 was a member of the genus Methanospirillum and showed 97.5 {\%} sequence similarity to Methanospirillum hungatei JF1T and 94 {\%} sequence similarity to Methanospirillum lacunae Ki8-1T. DNA–DNA hybridization of strain Pt1 with Methanospirillum hungatei JF1T revealed 39 {\%} relatedness.

abstract = {A methanogen, strain AK-1, was isolated from permanently cold marine sediments, 38- to 45-cm below the sediment surface at Skan Bay, Alaska. The cells were highly irregular, nonmotile coccoids (diameter, 1 to 1.2 microm), occurring singly. Cells grew by reducing CO2 with H2 or formate as electron donor. Growth on formate was much slower than that on H2. Acetate, methanol, ethanol, 1- or 2-propanol, 1- or 2-butanol and trimethylamine were not catabolized. The cells required acetate, thiamine, riboflavin, a high concentration of vitamin B12, and peptones for growth; yeast extract stimulated growth but was not required. The cells grew fastest at 25 degrees C (range 5 degrees C to 25 degrees C), at a pH of 6.0-6.6 (growth range, pH 5.5-7.5), and at a salinity of 0.25-1.25 M Na+. Cells of this and other H2-using methanogens from saline environments metabolized H2 to a very low threshold pressure (less than 1 Pa) that was dependent on the methane partial pressure. We propose that the threshold pressure may be limited by the energetics of catabolism. The sequence of the 16S rDNA gene of strain AK-1 was most similar (98{\%}) to the sequences of Methanogenium cariaci JR-1 and Methanogeniumfrigidum Ace-2. DNA-DNA hybridization between strain AK-1 and these two strains showed only 34.9{\%} similarity to strain JR-1 and 56.5{\%} similarity to strain Ace-2. These analyses indicated strain AK-1 should be classified as a new species within the genus Methanogenium. Phenotypic differences between strain AK-1 and these strains (including growth temperature, salinity range, pH range, and nutrient requirements) support this. Therefore, a new species, Methanogenium marinum, is proposed with strain AK-1 as type strain.},

abstract = {An autotrophic, hydrogenotrophic methanogen, designated strain 17A1T, was isolated from the profundal sediment of the meromictic Lake Pavin, France. The cells of the novel strain, which were non-motile, Gram-staining-negative rods that measured 2–15 µm in length and 0.2–0.4 µm in width, grew as filaments. Strain 17A1T grew in a mineral medium and its growth was stimulated by the addition of yeast extract, vitamins, acetate or rumen fluid. Penicillin, vancomycin and kanamycin reduced growth but did not completely inhibit it. Growth occurred at 14–41 °C (optimum 30 °C), at pH 5.0–8.5 (optimum pH 6.5) and with 0–0.4 M NaCl (optimum 0.1 M). The novel strain utilized H2/CO2 and methanol/H2 as substrates but not formate, acetate, methylamine/H2, isobutanol or 2-propanol. Its genomic DNA G+C content was 37.0 mol{\%}. In phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain 17A1T appeared to be a member of the genus Methanobacterium, with Methanobacterium beijingense 8-2T (96.3 {\%} sequence similarity) identified as the most closely related established species. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic data, strain 17A1T represents a novel species of methanogen within the genus Methanobacterium, for which the name Methanobacterium lacus sp. nov. is proposed.

abstract = {A small irregular coccoid methanogenic bacterium (PAT) was isolated from the hindgut of the cockroach Periplaneta americana. Fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy of the hindgut of P. americana suggest that the organism occurs abundantly in the microbiota attached to the hindgut wall. The strain produces methane by the reduction of methanol and methylated amines with molecular hydrogen. Acetate, coenzyme M, yeast extract, tryptic soy broth and vitamins are required for growth. The cells lack a rigid cell wall and lyse immediately in buffers of low ionic strength. Maximum rate of growth (specific growth rate, 0.22 h(-1)) occurs in a rich medium at 39 degrees C, at a pH range of 7.2-7.7 and at a salt concentration below 100 mM NaCl. Sequence analysis of the small-subunit rDNA indicates that strain PAT is related to the family Methanosarcinaceae but does not belong to any previously described genus. Therefore, it is proposed that strain PAT be classified in a new genus, related to the Methanosarcinaceae, as Methanomicrococcus blatticola (type strain PAT = DSM 13328T).},

Strains AK-4 (=OCM 774), AK-5T (=OCM 775T=DSM 17273T) and AK-9 (=OCM 793) were isolated from the sulfate-reducing zone of the sediments. Each of the strains was a non-motile coccus and occurred singly. Cells grew with trimethylamine as a catabolic substrate and strain AK-4 could also catabolize methanol. Yeast extract and trypticase peptones were not required for growth, but their addition to the culture medium slightly stimulated growth. Each of the strains grew at temperatures of 5-28 degrees C; they were slight halophiles and grew fastest in the neutral pH range. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain AK-4 was most closely related to Methanosarcina baltica. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed 88 {\%} relatedness, suggesting that strain AK-4 represents a novel strain within this species. Strains AK-5T and AK-9 had identical 16S rRNA gene sequences that were most closely related to the sequence of Methanococcoides burtonii (99.8 {\%} sequence similarity). DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed that strains AK-5T and AK-9 are members of the same species (88 {\%} relatedness value), but strain AK-5T had a DNA-DNA relatedness value of only 55 {\%} to Methanococcoides burtonii. This indicates that strains AK-5T and AK-9 should be considered as members of a novel species in the genus Methanococcoides.

abstract = {Two morphologically distinct, H2- and CO2-utilizing methanogens were isolated from gut homogenates of the subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) (Rhinotermitidae). Strain RFM-1 was a short straight rod (0.4 by 1.2 mm), whereas strain RFM-2 was a slightly curved rod (0.34 by 1.6 mm) that possessed polar fibers. Their morphology, gram-positive staining reaction, resistance to cell lysis by chemical agents, and narrow range of utilizable substrates were typical of species belonging to the family Methanobacteriaceae. Analysis of the nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rRNA-encoding genes confirmed this affiliation and supported their recognition as new species of Methanobrevibacter: M. cuticularis (RFM-1) and M. curvatus (RFM-2). The per cell rates of methanogenesis by strains RFM-1 and RFM-2 in vitro, taken together with their in situ population densities (ca. 106 cells z gut21; equivalent to 109 cells z ml of gut fluid21), could fully account for the rate of methane emission by the live termites. UV epifluorescence and electron microscopy confirmed that RFM-1- and RFM-2-type cells were the dominant methanogens in R. flavipes collected in Michigan (but were not the only methanogens associated with this species) and that they colonized the peripheral, microoxic region of the hindgut, i.e., residing on or near the hindgut epithelium and also attached to filamentous prokaryotes associated with the gut wall. An examination of their oxygen tolerance revealed that both strains possessed catalase-like activity. Moreover, when dispersed in tubes of agar medium under H2-CO2-O2 (75: 18.8:6.2, vol/vol/vol), both strains grew to form a thin plate about 6 mm below the meniscus, just beneath the oxic-anoxic interface. Such growth plates were capable of mediating a net consumption of O2 that otherwise penetrated much deeper into uninoculated control tubes. Similar results were obtained with an authentic strain of Methanobrevibacter arboriphilicus.

Neither trypticase peptone nor yeast extract was required for growth. The major membrane lipids of strain MC-20(T) were archaeol phosphatidylethanolamine and diglycosyl archaeol, while archaeol phosphatidylinositol and glycosyl archaeol were present only in minor amounts. Optimal growth was observed at 33 °C, pH 7.4 and 0.08 M NaCl. Based on phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain MC-20(T) was closely affiliated with Methanobacterium oryzae FPi(T) (similarity 97.1{\%}) and Methanobacterium lacus 17A1(T) (97.0{\%}). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 33.0 mol{\%}. Based on phenotypic and genotypic differences, strain MC-20(T) was assigned to a novel species of the genus Methanobacterium for which the name Methanobacterium movilense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MC-20(T) ( = DSM 26032(T) = JCM 18470(T)).},

abstract = {Methanosarcina sp. strain TM-1, an acetotrophic, thermophilic methanogen isolated from an anaerobic sludge digestor, was originally reported to require an anaerobic sludge supernatant for growth. It was found that the sludge supernatant could be replaced with yeast extract (1 g/liter), 6 mM bicarbonate-30{\%} CO(2), and trace metals, with a doubling time on methanol of 14 h. For growth on either methanol or acetate, yeast extract could be replaced with CaCl(2) . 2H(2)O (13.6 muM minimum) and the vitamin p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA, ca. 3 nM minimum), with a doubling time on methanol of 8 to 9 h. Filter-sterilized folic acid at 0.3 muM could not replace PABA. The antimetabolite sulfanilamide (20 mM) inhibited growth of and methanogenesis by Methanosarcina sp. strain TM-1, and this inhibition was reversed by the addition of 0.3 muM PABA. When a defined medium buffered with 20 mM N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid was used, it was shown that Methanosarcina sp. strain TM-1 required 6 mM bicarbonate-30{\%} CO(2) for optimal growth and methanogenesis from methanol. Cells growing on acetate were less dependent on bicarbonate-CO(2). When we used a defined medium in which the only organic compounds present were methanol or acetate, nitrilotriacetic acid (0.2 mM), and PABA, it was possible to limit batch cultures of Methanosarcina sp. strain TM-1 for nitrogen at NH(4) concentrations at or below 2.0 mM, in marked contrast with Methanosarcina barkeri 227, which fixes dinitrogen when grown under NH(4) limitation.},

The biomass was investigated at a molecular level to determine the links between the operational parameters of anaerobic digestion and methanogenic Archaea structure. The highest production of biogas with methane content of ca. 67{\%} was noted in the mesophilic microwave-heated reactors. The production of methane-rich biogas and the overall diversity of Archaea was determined by Methanosarcinaceae presence. The temperature and the application of microwaves were the main factors explaining the variations in the methanogen community. At 35 °C, the microwave heating stimulated the growth of highly diverse methanogen assemblages, promoting Methanosarcina barkeri presence and excluding Methanosarcina harudinacea from the biomass. A temperature increase to 55 °C lowered Methanosarcinaceae abundance and induced a replacement of Methanoculleus palmolei by Methanosarcina thermophila.},

abstract = {The Zoige wetland of the Tibetan plateau is at permanent low temperatures and is a methane emission heartland of the plateau; however, cold-adaptive methanogens in the soil are poorly understood. In this study, a variety of methanogenic enrichments at 15 degrees C and 30 degrees C were obtained from the wetland soil. It was demonstrated that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the most efficient type at 30 degrees C, while methanol supported the highest methanogenesis rate at 15 degrees C. Moreover, methanol was the only substrate to produce methane more efficiently at 15 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. A novel psychrophilic methanogen, strain R15, was isolated from the methanol enrichment at 15 degrees C. Phylogenetic analysis placed strain R15 within the genus Methanolobus, loosely clustered with Methanolobus taylorii (96.7{\%} 16S rRNA similarity). R15 produced methane from methanol, trimethylamine, and methyl sulfide and differed from other Methanolobus species by growing and producing methane optimally at 18 degrees C (specific growth rate of 0.063 +/- 0.001 h(-1)) and even at 0 degrees C. Based on these characteristics, R15 was proposed to be a new species and named "Methanolobus psychrophilus" sp. nov. The K(m) and V(max) of R15 for methanol conversion were determined to be 87.5 +/- 0.4 microM and 0.39 +/- 0.04 mM h(-1) at 18 degrees C, respectively, indicating a high affinity and conversion efficiency for methanol. The proportion of R15 in the soil was determined by quantitative PCR, and it accounted for 17.2{\%} +/- 2.1{\%} of the total archaea, enumerated as 10(7) per gram of soil; the proportion was increased to 42.4{\%} +/- 2.3{\%} in the methanol enrichment at 15 degrees C. This study suggests that the psychrophilic methanogens in the Zoige wetland are likely to be methylotrophic and to play a role in methane emission of the wetland.},

abstract = {Characteristics of an obligately methylotrophic coccoid methanogen (strain GS-16) previously isolated from estuarine sediment are described. Growth was demonstrated on dimethyl sulfide (DMS) or trimethylamine (TMA), but not on methane thiol, methane thiol plus hydrogen, dimethyl disulfide, or methionine. DMS-grown cells were able to metabolize DMS and TMA simultaneously when inoculated into media containing substrate levels of these compounds. However, TMA-grown cells could not metabolize [C]DMS to CH(4), although they could convert [C]methanol to CH(4). These results suggest that metabolism of DMS proceeds along a somewhat different route than that of TMA and perhaps also that of methanol. The organism exhibited doubling times of 23 and 32 h for growth (25 degrees C) in mineral media on TMA and DMS, respectively. Doubling times were more rapid ( approximately 6 h) when the organisms were grown on TMA in complex broth. In mineral media, the fastest growth on DMS occurred between pH levels of 7.0 and 8.7, at 29 degrees C, and with 0.2 to 0.4 M Na and 0.04 M Mg. Somewhat different results occurred for growth on TMA in complex broth. Cells had a moles percent G+C value of 44.5{\%} for their DNA. Growth on DMS, TMA, and methanol yielded stable carbon isotope fractionation factors of 1.044, 1.037, and 1.063, respectively. Fractionation factors for hydrogen were 1.203 (DMS) and 1.183 (TMA).},

abstract = {An anaerobic baffled reactor with four compartments (C1-C4) was successfully used for treatment of acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation wastewater and methane production. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was 88.2{\%} with a CH(4) yield of 0.25L/(g COD(removed)) when organic loading rate (OLR) was 5.4kg CODm(-3)d(-1). C1 played the most important role in solvents (acetone, butanol and ethanol) and COD removal. Community structure of C2 was similar to that in C1 at stage 3 with higher OLR, but was similar to those in C3 and C4 at stages 1-2 with lower OLR. This community variation in C2 was consistent with its increased role in COD and solvent removal at stage 3. During community succession from C1 to C4 at stage 3, abundance of Firmicutes (especially OTUs ABRB07 and ABRB10) and Methanoculleus decreased, while Bacteroidetes and Methanocorpusculum became dominant. Thus, ABRB07 coupled with Methanoculleus and/or acetogen (ABRB10) may be key species for solvents degradation.},

abstract = {Archaea (archaebacteria) are a phenotypically diverse group of microorganisms that share a common evolutionary history. There are four general phenotypic groups of archaea: the methanogens, the extreme halophiles, the sulfate-reducing archaea, and the extreme thermophiles. In the marine environment, archaeal habitats are generally limited to shallow or deep-sea anaerobic sediments (free-living and endosymbiotic methanogens), hot springs or deep-sea hydrothermal vents (methanogens, sulfate reducers, and extreme thermophiles), and highly saline land-locked seas (halophiles). This report provides evidence for the widespread occurrence of unusual archaea in oxygenated coastal surface waters of North America. Quantitative estimates indicated that up to 2{\%} of the total ribosomal RNA extracted from coastal bacterioplankton assemblages was archaeal. Archaeal small-subunit ribosomal RNA-encoding DNAs (rDNAs) were cloned from mixed bacterioplankton populations collected at geographically distant sampling sites. Phylogenetic and nucleotide signature analyses of these cloned rDNAs revealed the presence of two lineages of archaea, each sharing the diagnostic signatures and structural features previously established for the domain Archaea. Both of these lineages were found in bacterioplankton populations collected off the east and west coasts of North America. The abundance and distribution of these archaea in oxic coastal surface waters suggests that these microorganisms represent undescribed physiological types of archaea, which reside and compete with aerobic, mesophilic eubacteria in marine coastal environments.},

Although the early emphasis of microbial genomics was on human pathogens for obvious reasons, a significant number of sequencing projects have focused on nonpathogenic organisms, beginning with the release of the complete genome sequence of the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii in 1996. The past 18 months have seen the completion of the genomes of several unusual organisms, including Thermotoga maritima, whose genome reveals extensive potential lateral transfer with archaea; Deinococcus radiodurans, the most radiation-resistant microorganism known; and Aeropyrum pernix, the first Crenarchaeota to be completely sequenced. Although the functional characterization of genomic data is still in its initial stages, it is likely that microbial genomics will have a significant impact on environmental, food, and industrial biotechnology as well as on genomic medicine.},

abstract = {We live on a cold planet where more than 80{\%} of the biosphere is permanently below 5 degrees C, and yet comparatively little is known about the genetics and physiology of the microorganisms inhabiting these environments. Based on molecular probe and sequencing studies, it is clear that Archaea are numerically abundant in diverse low-temperature environments throughout the globe. In addition, non-low-temperature-adapted Archaea are commonly exposed to sudden decreases in temperature, as are other microorganisms, animals, and plants. Considering their ubiquity in nature, it is perhaps surprising to find that there is such a lack of knowledge regarding low-temperature adaptation mechanisms in Archaea, particularly in comparison to what is known about archaeal thermophiles and hyperthermophiles and responses to heat shock. This review covers what is presently known about adaptation to cold shock and growth at low temperature, with a particular focus on Antarctic Archaea. The review highlights the similarities and differences that exist between Archaea and Bacteria and eukaryotes, and addresses the potentially important role that protein synthesis plays in adaptation to the cold. By reviewing the present state of the field, a number of important areas for future research are identified.},

abstract = {Archaea are abundant and drive critical microbial processes in the Earth's cold biosphere. Despite this, not enough is known about the molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation and no biochemical studies have been performed on stenopsychrophilic archaea (e.g., Methanogenium frigidum). This study examined the structural and functional properties of cold shock proteins (Csps) from archaea, including biochemical analysis of the Csp from M. frigidum. csp genes are present in most bacteria and some eucarya but absent from most archaeal genome sequences, most notably, those of all archaeal thermophiles and hyperthermophiles. In bacteria, Csps are small, nucleic acid binding proteins involved in a variety of cellular processes, such as transcription. In this study, archaeal Csp function was assessed by examining the ability of csp genes from psychrophilic and mesophilic Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota to complement a cold-sensitive growth defect in Escherichia coli. In addition, an archaeal gene with a cold shock domain (CSD) fold but little sequence identity to Csps was also examined. Genes encoding Csps or a CSD structural analog from three psychrophilic archaea rescued the E. coli growth defect. The three proteins were predicted to have a higher content of solvent-exposed basic residues than the noncomplementing proteins, and the basic residues were located on the nucleic acid binding surface, similar to their arrangement in E. coli CspA. The M. frigidum Csp was purified and found to be a single-domain protein that folds by a reversible two-state mechanism and to exhibit a low conformational stability typical of cold-adapted proteins. Moreover, M. frigidum Csp was characterized as binding E. coli single-stranded RNA, consistent with its ability to complement function in E. coli. The studies show that some Csp and CSD fold proteins have retained sufficient similarity throughout evolution in the Archaea to be able to function effectively in the Bacteria and that the function of the archaeal proteins relates to cold adaptation. The initial biochemical analysis of M. frigidum Csp has developed a platform for further characterization and demonstrates the potential for expanding molecular studies of proteins from this important archaeal stenopsychrophile.},

Methanogenic archaea are ubiquitous on earth and produce a large amount of methane (CH(4)) as their main carbon metabolite. Methanogens are the most laboratory amendable archaea. The few psychrophilic archaea that have been cultured to date are mainly affiliated with methanogens, thus make them a good model for investigating mechanisms of archaeal cold adaptation. Studies of psychrotolerant methanogens have been ongoing since the 1990s. Using Methanococcoides burtonii, a methanogen isolated from Ace Lake in Antarctica, extensive studies on the genomic characteristics associated with cold adaptation have been carried out by the Cavicchioli laboratory. We recently analyzed the genome of another psychrophilic methanogen and identified the gene repertoire associated with cold adaptation. This review summarizes recent studies of psychroactive methanogens, particularly their diversity, the genomics and proteomics associated with their cold adaptation, and the cellular components and proteins likely involved in their cold protection.},

abstract = {We generated draft genome sequences for two cold-adapted Archaea, Methanogenium frigidum and Methanococcoides burtonii, to identify genotypic characteristics that distinguish them from Archaea with a higher optimal growth temperature (OGT). Comparative genomics revealed trends in amino acid and tRNA composition, and structural features of proteins. Proteins from the cold-adapted Archaea are characterized by a higher content of noncharged polar amino acids, particularly Gln and Thr and a lower content of hydrophobic amino acids, particularly Leu. Sequence data from nine methanogen genomes (OGT 15 degrees -98 degrees C) were used to generate 1111 modeled protein structures. Analysis of the models from the cold-adapted Archaea showed a strong tendency in the solvent-accessible area for more Gln, Thr, and hydrophobic residues and fewer charged residues. A cold shock domain (CSD) protein (CspA homolog) was identified in M. frigidum, two hypothetical proteins with CSD-folds in M. burtonii, and a unique winged helix DNA-binding domain protein in M. burtonii. This suggests that these types of nucleic acid binding proteins have a critical role in cold-adapted Archaea. Structural analysis of tRNA sequences from the Archaea indicated that GC content is the major factor influencing tRNA stability in hyperthermophiles, but not in the psychrophiles, mesophiles or moderate thermophiles. Below an OGT of 60 degrees C, the GC content in tRNA was largely unchanged, indicating that any requirement for flexibility of tRNA in psychrophiles is mediated by other means. This is the first time that comparisons have been performed with genome data from Archaea spanning the growth temperature extremes from psychrophiles to hyperthermophiles.},

abstract = {The unusual compound beta-aminoglutaric acid (beta-glutamate) has been identified by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in soluble extracts of marine methanogenic bacteria. We examined several methanogen species representing nine genera and found that beta-glutamate occurred in methanococci and two methanogenium strains (Methanogenium cariaci JR1 and "Methanogenium anulus" AN9). The presence of this compound in the methanococci examined was further restricted to thermophilic members of the genus Methanococcus, including Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus strains, Methanococcus jannaschii, and "Methanococcus igneus." The two Methanogenium strains examined were mesophiles. Studies using Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus showed that levels of beta-glutamate in cells of that species were not affected by variation in growth temperature (40 to 65 degrees C), NH4+ (2 to 80 mM), Mg2+ (10 to 50 mM), or K+ (2 to 10 mM) in the medium. In contrast, soluble pools of beta-glutamate and L-alpha-glutamate (the other major free amino acid in all the methanococci) were proportional to NaCl levels in the growth medium. This dependence of beta-glutamate and L-alpha-glutamate concentrations on salt levels in the medium suggests that they function as osmolytes in these cells.},

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analyses of 13CH3OH-12CO2 label incorporation by the cells provide information on the biosynthetic pathways of these organic osmolytes. The labeling studies indicate that Methanohalophilus strain FDF1 produces glutamate and beta-glutamine via a partial oxidative Krebs pathway. 13C labeling of betaine is consistent with methylation of glycine generated from serine (via serine hydroxymethyltransferase). The labeling pattern for N epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine is consistent with the synthesis of its precursor alpha-lysine occurring by the diaminopimelate pathway in these cells.},

abstract = {A method based on sequence-specific cleavage of rRNA with ribonuclease H was used to detect almost all known cultivable methanogens in anaerobic biological treatment systems. To do so, a total of 40 scissor probes in different phylogeny specificities were designed or modified from previous studies, optimized for their specificities under digestion conditions with 32 methanogenic reference strains, and then applied to detect methanogens in sludge samples taken from 6 different anaerobic treatment processes. Among these processes, known aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic groups of methanogens from the families Methanosarcinaceae, Methanosaetaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanothermaceae and Methanocaldococcaceae could be successfully detected and identified down to the genus level. Within the aceticlastic methanogens, the abundances of mesophilic Methanosaeta accounted for 5.7-48.5{\%} of the total archaeal populations in mesophilic anaerobic processes, and those of Methanosarcina represented 41.7{\%} of the total archaeal populations in thermophilic processes. For hydrogenotrophic methanogens, members of the Methanomicrobiales, Methanobrevibacter and Methanobacterium were detected in mesophilic processes (1.2-17.2{\%}), whereas those of Methanothermobacter, Methanothermaceae and Methanocaldococcaceae were detected in thermophilic process (2.0-4.8{\%}). Overall results suggested that those hierarchical scissor probes developed could be effective for rapid and possibly on-site monitoring of targeted methanogens in different microbial environments.},

abstract = {Methanogenesis from the biomass in the anoxic biogas reactors is catalyzed by syntrophic cooperation between anaerobic bacteria, syntrophic acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea. Understanding of microbial community composition within the biogas reactors may improve the methane production from biomass fermentation. In this study, methanogenic archaea diverity of a biogas reactor supplied with swine feces as mono-substrate under mesophilic conditions was investigated. Community composition was determined by analysis of methyl coenzyme reductase subunit A gene (mcrA) clone library consisting of 123 clones. Statistical analysis of mcrA library indicated that all major groups of methanogens from our biogas reactor were detected. In the library, 57.7{\%} clones were affiliated to Methanobacteriales, 34.2{\%} to Methanomicrobiales, 2.4{\%} to Methanosarcinales and about 5.7{\%} clones belonged to unclassified euryarchaeota. Over 90{\%} of the methanogenic archaea from our biogas reactor were postulated to be hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Comparing with other previous studies reporting that hydrogenotrophic methanogens are dominant species in the biogas plants, this study firstly reported that Methanobacteriales instead of Methanomicrobiales are the most predominant methanogenic archaea in the biogas reactor fed with swine feces as sole substrate.},

abstract = {A novel mesophilic, hydrogenotrophic methanogen, designated strain TNRT, was isolated from an anaerobic, propionate-degradation enrichment culture that was originally established from a rice field soil sample from Taiwan. Cells were non-motile rods, 2.0–6.5 µm long by 0.3 µm wide. Filamentous (up to about 100 µm) and coccoid (about 1 µm in diameter) cells were also observed in cultures in the late exponential phase of growth. Strain TNRT grew at 20–40 °C (optimally at 37 °C), at pH 6.5–7.4 (optimally at pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0–25 g NaCl l−1 (optimally at 0 g NaCl l−1). The strain utilized H2/CO2 and formate for growth and produced methane. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.4 mol{\%}. Based on sequences of both the 16S rRNA gene and the methanogen-specific marker gene mcrA, strain TNRT was related most closely to Methanolinea tarda NOBI-1T; levels of sequence similarities were 94.8 and 86.4 {\%}, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity indicates that strain TNRT and M. tarda NOBI-1T represent different species within the same genus. This is supported by shared phenotypic properties, including substrate usage and cell morphology, and differences in growth temperature. Based on these genetic and phenotypic properties, strain TNRT is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Methanolinea, for which the name Methanolinea mesophila sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is TNRT ( = NBRC 105659T = DSM 23604T). In addition, we also suggest family status for the E1/E2 group within the order Methanomicrobiales, for which the name Methanoregulaceae fam. nov. is proposed; the type genus of family is Methanoregula.},

abstract = {Previous studies suggested that methanol and acetate were the likely methanogenic precursors in the cold Zoige wetland. In this study, the contribution of the two substances to methanogenesis and the conversion in Zoige wetland were analyzed. It was determined that methanol supported the highest CH(4) formation rate in the enrichments of the soil grown with Eleocharis valleculosa, and even higher at 15 degrees C than at 30 degrees C; while hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was higher at 30 degrees C. Both methanol- and acetate-using methanogens were counted at the highest (10(7) g(-1)) in the soil, whereas methanol-using acetogens (10(8) g(-1)) were ten times more abundant than either methanol- or acetate-using methanogens. Both methanol and acetate were detected in the methanogenesis-inhibited soil samples, so that both could be the primary methanogenic precursors in E. valleculosa soil. However, the levels of methanol and acetate accumulated in 2-bromoethane-sulfonate (BES)- and CHCl(3)-treated soils were in reverse, i.e., higher methanol in CHCl(3)- and higher acetate in BES-treated soil, so that methanol-derived methanogenesis could be underestimated due to the consumption by acetogens. Analysis of the soil 16S rRNA genes revealed Acetobacterum bakii and Trichococcus pasteurii to be the dominant methanol-using acetogens in the soil, and a strain of T. pasteurii was isolated, which showed the high conversion of methanol to acetate at 15 degrees C.},

The cells were motile, irregular cocci (diameter, 0.9-1.2 microm) and occurred singly, in pairs, as tetracocci or (occasionally) as aggregates. Strain MobM(T) grew at 9-37 degrees C (optimally at 30 degrees C) and at pH 6.1-7.8 (optimally at pH 6.5).

abstract = {We have determined the complete 1,694,969-nt sequence of the GC-rich genome of Methanopyrus kandleri by using a whole direct genome sequencing approach. This approach is based on unlinking of genomic DNA with the ThermoFidelase version of M. kandleri topoisomerase V and cycle sequencing directed by 2'-modified oligonucleotides (Fimers). Sequencing redundancy (3.3x) was sufficient to assemble the genome with less than one error per 40 kb. Using a combination of sequence database searches and coding potential prediction, 1,692 protein-coding genes and 39 genes for structural RNAs were identified. M. kandleri proteins show an unusually high content of negatively charged amino acids, which might be an adaptation to the high intracellular salinity. Previous phylogenetic analysis of 16S RNA suggested that M. kandleri belonged to a very deep branch, close to the root of the archaeal tree. However, genome comparisons indicate that, in both trees constructed using concatenated alignments of ribosomal proteins and trees based on gene content, M. kandleri consistently groups with other archaeal methanogens. M. kandleri shares the set of genes implicated in methanogenesis and, in part, its operon organization with Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicum. These findings indicate that archaeal methanogens are monophyletic. A distinctive feature of M. kandleri is the paucity of proteins involved in signaling and regulation of gene expression. Also, M. kandleri appears to have fewer genes acquired via lateral transfer than other archaea. These features might reflect the extreme habitat of this organism.},

abstract = {We report here a comparative analysis of the genome sequence of Methanosarcina barkeri with those of Methanosarcina acetivorans and Methanosarcina mazei. The genome of M. barkeri is distinguished by having an organization that is well conserved with respect to the other Methanosarcina spp. in the region proximal to the origin of replication, with interspecies gene similarities as high as 95{\%}. However, it is disordered and marked by increased transposase frequency and decreased gene synteny and gene density in the distal semigenome. Of the 3,680 open reading frames (ORFs) in M. barkeri, 746 had homologs with better than 80{\%} identity to both M. acetivorans and M. mazei, while 128 nonhypothetical ORFs were unique (nonorthologous) among these species, including a complete formate dehydrogenase operon, genes required for N-acetylmuramic acid synthesis, a 14-gene gas vesicle cluster, and a bacterial-like P450-specific ferredoxin reductase cluster not previously observed or characterized for this genus. A cryptic 36-kbp plasmid sequence that contains an orc1 gene flanked by a presumptive origin of replication consisting of 38 tandem repeats of a 143-nucleotide motif was detected in M. barkeri. Three-way comparison of these genomes reveals differing mechanisms for the accrual of changes. Elongation of the relatively large M. acetivorans genome is the result of uniformly distributed multiple gene scale insertions and duplications, while the M. barkeri genome is characterized by localized inversions associated with the loss of gene content. In contrast, the short M. mazei genome most closely approximates the putative ancestral organizational state of these species.},

The isolate was a strictly anaerobic, methanogenic autotroph capable of using hydrogen and carbon dioxide as sole energy and carbon sources. Formate was utilized as an alternative energy source. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 33.3 mol{\%}. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the isolate was most closely related to Methanotorris igneus strain Kol 5T. The isolate, however, could be genetically differentiated from this species by DNA-DNA hybridization analysis and on the basis of its physiological properties.

@article{Lomans1999,
abstract = {A newly isolated methanogen, strain DMS1(T), is the first obligately anaerobic archaeon which was directly enriched and isolated from a freshwater sediment in defined minimal medium containing dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as the sole carbon and energy source. The use of a chemostat with a continuous DMS-containing gas stream as a method of enrichment, followed by cultivation in deep agar tubes, resulted in a pure culture. Since the only substrates utilized by strain DMS1(T) are methanol, methylamines, methanethiol (MT), and DMS, this organism is considered an obligately methylotrophic methanogen like most other DMS-degrading methanogens. Strain DMS1(T) differs from all other DMS-degrading methanogens, since it was isolated from a freshwater pond and requires NaCl concentrations (0 to 0.04 M) typical of the NaCl concentrations required by freshwater microorganisms for growth. DMS was degraded effectively only in a chemostat culture in the presence of low hydrogen sulfide and MT concentrations. Addition of MT or sulfide to the chemostat significantly decreased degradation of DMS. Transient accumulation of DMS in MT-amended cultures indicated that transfer of the first methyl group during DMS degradation is a reversible process. On the basis of its low level of homology with the most closely related methanogen, Methanococcoides burtonii (94.5{\%}), its position on the phylogenetic tree, its morphology (which is different from that of members of the genera Methanolobus, Methanococcoides, and Methanohalophilus), and its salt tolerance and optimum (which are characteristic of freshwater bacteria), we propose that strain DMS1(T) is a representative of a novel genus. This isolate was named Methanomethylovorans hollandica. Analysis of DMS-amended sediment slurries with a fluorescence microscope revealed the presence of methanogens which were morphologically identical to M. hollandica, as described in this study. Considering its physiological properties, M. hollandica DMS1(T) is probably responsible for degradation of MT and DMS in freshwater sediments in situ. Due to the reversibility of the DMS conversion, methanogens like strain DMS1(T) can also be involved in the formation of DMS through methylation of MT. This phenomenon, which previously has been shown to occur in sediment slurries of freshwater origin, might affect the steady-state concentrations and, consequently, the total flux of DMS and MT in these systems.},

abstract = {During attempts to obtain novel, human-associated species of the domain Archaea, a coccoid micro-organism, designated strain B10(T), was isolated in pure culture from a sample of human faeces collected in Marseille, France. On the basis of its phenotypic characteristics and 16S rRNA and mcrA gene sequences, the novel strain was classified as a methanogenic archaeon. Cells of the strain were non-motile, Gram-staining-positive cocci that were approximately 850 nm in diameter and showed autofluorescence at 420 nm. Cells were lysed by 0.1{\%} (w/v) SDS. With hydrogen as the electron donor, strain B10(T) produced methane by reducing methanol. The novel strain was unable to produce methane when hydrogen or methanol was the sole energy source. In an atmosphere containing CO(2), strain B10(T) could not produce methane from formate, acetate, trimethylamine, 2-butanol, 2-propanol, cyclopentanol, 2-pentanol, ethanol, 1-propanol or 2,3-butanediol. Strain B10(T) grew optimally with 0.5-1.0{\%} (w/v) NaCl, at pH 7.6 and at 37 °C. It required tungstate-selenite for growth. The complete genome of the novel strain was sequenced; the size of the genome was estimated to be 2.05 Mb and the genomic DNA G+C content was 59.93 mol{\%}. In phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, the highest sequence similarities (98.0-98.7{\%}) were seen between strain B10(T) and several uncultured, methanogenic Archaea that had been collected from the digestive tracts of a cockroach, a chicken and mammals. In the same analysis, the non-methanogenic 'Candidatus Aciduliprofundum boonei' DSM 19572 was identified as the cultured micro-organism that was most closely related to strain B10(T) (83.0{\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Each of the three treeing algorithms used in the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain B10(T) belongs to a novel order that is distinct from the Thermoplasmatales. The novel strain also appeared to be distinct from Methanosphaera stadtmanae DSM 3091(T) (72.9{\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), another methanogenic archaeon that was isolated from human faeces and can use methanol in the presence of hydrogen. Based on the genetic and phenotypic evidence, strain B10(T) represents a novel species of a new genus for which the name Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is B10(T) ( = DSM 24529(T) = CSUR P135(T)).},

Cells of both isolates were rods (about 0.3-0.5×2-5 µm) with blunt rounded ends and Gram-staining-positive. Strain TS-2(T) was motile with one or two polar flagella and used only H(2)/CO(2) for growth and methanogenesis. Strain GH(T) was non-motile, used both H(2)/CO(2) and formate and displayed a variable cell arrangement depending on the substrate: long chains when growing in formate (50 mM) or under high pressure H(2) and single cells under low pressure H(2). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the two isolates in the genus Methanobacterium. Strain TS-2(T) was most closely related to Methanobacterium alcaliphilum NBRC 105226(T) (96{\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Phylogenetic analysis based on the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase also supported the affiliation of the two isolates with the genus Methanobacterium.

abstract = {A pure culture of an obligately anaerobic, hydrogenotrophic, methanogenic archaeon, designated strain 169(T), which grows with hydrogen and carbon dioxide as the sole energy and carbon sources, was isolated from an anaerobic propionate-oxidizing enrichment culture originally obtained as an inoculant from rice-field soil in Japan. Cells of strain 169(T) were non-motile, Gram-reaction-variable and rod-shaped or slightly curved rods with rounded ends (1.6-5.0 × 0.35-0.5 µm). Strain 169(T) had fimbriae at both ends of the cell (up to {\~{}}10 per cell) but did not possess flagella. Ultrathin sections showed a single-layered, electron-dense cell wall about 6 nm thick, which is typical of Gram-positive bacteria. Growth was observed at 15 °C-45 °C (optimum 40 °C), at pH 6.5-9.6 (optimum pH 7.5-8.5) and in 0-70 g NaCl l(-1) (0-1.2 M) (optimum 5 g NaCl l(-1); 0.086 M). Strain 169(T) utilized only hydrogen and carbon dioxide as energy and carbon sources. The DNA G+C content was 39.3 mol{\%}. The results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain 169(T) was most closely related to Methanobacterium subterraneum DSM 11074(T) (96.8 {\%} sequence similarity) and Methanobacterium formicicum DSM 1535(T) (96.4 {\%}). On the basis of its morphological, physiological and phylogenetic characteristics, strain 169(T) ( = DSM 22026(T) = JCM 15797(T)) represents a novel species of the genus Methanobacterium, for which the name Methanobacterium kanagiense sp. nov. is proposed.},

abstract = {This study summarizes the findings of our research on the genesis of methane, its content and distribution in permafrost horizons of different age and origin. Supported by reliable data from a broad geographical sweep, these findings confirm the presence of methane in permanently frozen fine-grained sediments. In contrast to the omnipresence of carbon dioxide in permafrost, methane-containing horizons (up to 40.0 mL kg(-1)) alternate with strata free of methane. Discrete methane-containing horizons representing over tens of thousands of years are indicative of the absence of methane diffusion through the frozen layers. Along with the isotopic composition of CH(4) carbon (delta(13)C -64 per thousand to -99 per thousand), this confirms its biological origin and points to in situ formation of this biogenic gas. Using (14)C-labeled substrates, the possibility of methane formation within permafrost was experimentally shown, as confirmed by delta(13)C values. Extremely low values (near -99 per thousand) indicate that the process of CH(4) formation is accompanied by the substantial fractionation of carbon isotopes. For the first time, cultures of methane-forming archaea, Methanosarcina mazei strain JL01 VKM B-2370, Methanobacterium sp. strain M2 VKM B-2371 and Methanobacterium sp. strain MK4 VKM B-2440 from permafrost, were isolated and described.},

abstract = {Among methanogens, only 2 genera, Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina, are known to contribute to methanogenesis from acetate, and Methanosaeta is a specialist that uses acetate specifically. However, Methanosaeta strains so far have mainly been isolated from anaerobic digesters, despite the fact that it is widespread, not only in anaerobic methanogenic reactors and freshwater environments, but also in marine environments, based upon extensive 16S rRNA gene-cloning analyses. In this study, we isolated an aceticlastic methanogen, designated strain 03d30q(T), from a tidal flat sediment. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and mcrA genes revealed that the isolate belongs to the genus Methanosaeta. Unlike the other known Methanosaeta species, this isolate grows at Na(+) concentrations of 0.20 to 0.80 M, with an optimum concentration of 0.28 M. Quantitative estimation using real-time PCR detected the 16S rRNA gene of the genus Methanosaeta in the marine sediment, and relative abundance ranged from 3.9{\%} to 11.8{\%} of the total archaeal 16S rRNA genes. In addition, the number of Methanosaeta organisms increased with increasing depth and was much higher than that of Methanosarcina organisms, suggesting that aceticlastic methanogens contribute to acetate metabolism to a greater extent than previously thought in marine environments, where sulfate-reducing acetate oxidation prevails. This is the first report on marine Methanosaeta species, and based on phylogenetic and characteristic studies, the name "Methanosaeta pelagica" sp. nov. is proposed for this novel species, with type strain 03d30q.},

abstract = {Syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is an alternative methanogenic pathway in certain thermophilic anaerobic environments such as high-temperature oil reservoirs and thermophilic biogas reactors. In these environments, the dominant thermophilic methanogens were generally related to uncultured organisms of the genus Methanothermobacter. Here we isolated two representative strains, Tm2(T) and HMD, from the oil sands and oil production water in the Shengli oil field in the People's Republic of China. The type strain, Tm2(T), was nonmotile and stained Gram positive. The cells were straight to slightly curved rods (0.3 $\mu$m in width and 2.2 to 5.9 $\mu$m in length), but some of them possessed a coccal shape connecting with the rods at the ends. Strain Tm2(T) grew with H(2)-CO(2), but acetate is required. Optimum growth of strain Tm2(T) occurred in the presence of 0.025 g/liter NaCl at pH 6.9 and a temperature of 65°C. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 40.1 mol{\%} ± 1.3 mol{\%} (by the thermal denaturation method) or 41.1 mol{\%} (by high-performance liquid chromatography). Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that Tm2(T) was most closely related to Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus $\Delta$H(T) and Methanothermobacter wolfeii VKM B-1829(T) (both with a sequence similarity of 96.4{\%}). Based on these phenotypic and phylogenic characteristics, a novel species was proposed and named Methanothermobacter crinale sp. nov. The type strain is Tm2(T) (ACCC 00699(T) = JCM 17393(T)).},

abstract = {Since compost is widely used as soil amendment and the fact that during the processing of compost material high amounts of microorganisms are released into the air, we investigated whether compost may act as a carrier for thermophilic methanogens to temperate soils. All eight investigated compost materials showed a clear methane production potential between 0.01 and 0.98 micromol CH(4) g dw(-1)h(-1) at 50 degrees C. Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and cloning analysis indicated the presence of Methanosarcina thermophila, Methanoculleus thermophilus, and Methanobacterium formicicum. Bioaerosols collected during the turning of a compost pile showed both a highly similar SSCP profile compared to the corresponding compost material and clear methane production during anoxic incubation in selective medium at 50 degrees C. Both observations indicated a considerable release of thermophilic methanogens into the air. To analyse the persistence of compost-borne thermophilic methanogens in temperate oxic soils, we therefore studied their potential activity in compost and compost/soil mixtures, which was brought to a meadow soil, as well as in an agricultural soil fertilised with compost. After 24h anoxic incubation at 50 degrees C, all samples containing compost showed a clear methanogenic activity, even 1 year after application. In combination with the in vitro observed resilience of the compost-borne methanogens against desiccation and UV radiation we assume that compost material acts as an effective carrier for the distribution of thermophilic methanogens by fertilisation and wind.},

abstract = {Methanogenesis, the biological production of methane, plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle and contributes significantly to global warming. The majority of methane in nature is derived from acetate. Here we report the complete genome sequence of an acetate-utilizing methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A. Methanosarcineae are the most metabolically diverse methanogens, thrive in a broad range of environments, and are unique among the Archaea in forming complex multicellular structures. This diversity is reflected in the genome of M. acetivorans. At 5,751,492 base pairs it is by far the largest known archaeal genome. The 4524 open reading frames code for a strikingly wide and unanticipated variety of metabolic and cellular capabilities. The presence of novel methyltransferases indicates the likelihood of undiscovered natural energy sources for methanogenesis, whereas the presence of single-subunit carbon monoxide dehydrogenases raises the possibility of nonmethanogenic growth. Although motility has not been observed in any Methanosarcineae, a flagellin gene cluster and two complete chemotaxis gene clusters were identified. The availability of genetic methods, coupled with its physiological and metabolic diversity, makes M. acetivorans a powerful model organism for the study of archaeal biology.

abstract = {Methanosarcina acetivorans, a strictly anaerobic methane-producing species belonging to the domain Archaea, contains a gene cluster annotated with homologs encoding oxidative stress proteins. One of the genes (MA3736) is annotated as a gene encoding an uncharacterized carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, an enzyme required for aerobic growth with aromatic compounds by species in the domain Bacteria. Methane-producing species are not known to utilize aromatic compounds, suggesting that MA3736 is incorrectly annotated. The product of MA3736, overproduced in Escherichia coli, had protein disulfide reductase activity dependent on a C(67)XXC(70) motif not found in carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase. We propose that MA3736 be renamed mdrA (methanosarcina disulfide reductase). Further, unlike carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, MdrA contained an Fe-S cluster. Binding of the Fe-S cluster was dependent on essential cysteines C(67) and C(70), while cysteines C(39) and C(107) were not required. Loss of the Fe-S cluster resulted in conversion of MdrA from an inactive hexamer to a trimer with protein disulfide reductase activity. The data suggest that MdrA is the prototype of a previously unrecognized protein disulfide reductase family which contains an intermolecular Fe-S cluster that controls oligomerization as a mechanism to regulate protein disulfide reductase activity.},

abstract = {To date, composting has been regarded as an aerobic process but it has been shown that composting piles are often sources of atmospheric methane. In order to gain a more comprehensive view on the diversity of methanogenic Archaea in compost, gas chromatographical methods and molecular cloning were used to study relationships of thermophilic archaeal communities and changes in methane production potential during compost maturation. According to the thermophilic methane production potential, wide differences could be detected between differently aged compost materials. In material derived from 3- and 4-week-old piles, low and no thermophilic methane production potential, respectively, was observed at 50 degrees C. Material from a 6-week-old pile showed the maximum methane production. With compost maturation, the production slowly decreased again with 6 weeks, 8 weeks, and mature compost showing an optimum methane production potential at 60 degrees C. At 70 degrees C, only 6-week-old material showed a comparable high production of methane. The 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic surveys revealed an increase of archaeal diversity with compost maturation. In the 6-week-old material, 86{\%} of the sequences in the archaeal 16S rRNA library had the highest sequence similarities to Methanothermobacter spp. and the remaining 14{\%} of the clones were related to Methanosarcina thermophila. Quantification of methanogens in 6-week-old material, on the basis of the methane production rate, resulted in values of about 2x10(7) cells per gram fresh weight. In 8-week-old and mature compost material, the proportion of sequences similar to Methanothermobacter spp. decreased to 34{\%} and 0{\%}, respectively. The mature compost material showed the highest variation in identified sequences, although 33{\%} could be assigned to as yet uncultured Archaea (e.g. Rice cluster I, III, and IV). Our results indicate that compost harbours a diverse community of thermophilic methanogens, with changing composition during the maturation process, presumably due to altered pile conditions. Likewise, compost may act as a potential carrier for thermophilic methanogens in temperate soils because it is widely used as a soil amendment.},

abstract = {The phylogeny and taxonomy of the mesophilic methane-producing archaea of the order Methanococcales were examined by DNA relatedness, 16S rRNA sequence analysis, cellular protein patterns, and phenotypic methods. The mesophilic species Methanococcus maripaludis, Methanococcus vannielii, Methanococcus voltaei, and "Methanococcus aeolicus" formed a deep group with 5 to 30{\%} DNA relatedness and 92 to 96{\%} 16S rRNA sequence similarity. Twenty-two additional isolates and Methanococcus deltae were similar to the type strain of either M. voltaei or M. maripaludis. Two isolates, strains A2 and A3, exhibited 37{\%} DNA relatedness and 99.2{\%} 16S rRNA sequence similarity to M. voltaei PS(T) (T = type strain). In the absence of phenotypic differences, these organisms were assigned to M. voltaei. Similarly, four autotrophic isolates, strains C5, C6, C7, and C8, exhibited 54 to 69{\%} DNA relatedness and 99.2{\%} 16S rRNA sequence similarity to M. maripaludis JJT and were assigned to M. Maripaludis. While these isolates were sufficiently genetically diverse to justify classification in novel species, few differences were apparent in the phenotypic properties available for measurement. Thus, the phenotypic properties of these lithotrophic archaea were highly conserved and poor indicators of genetic diversity. Partial sequencing of about 200 bases of both the 16S and 23S rRNAs of the isolates demonstrated allelic diversity within methanococcal species. This allelic diversity did not correlate with diversity measured by DNA relatedness, cellular protein pattern, and other methods. Similarly, antisera to whole cells of the type strains did not cross-react strongly to whole cells of strains that were genetically similar, and serological cross-reactivity was not a useful taxonomic method for methanococci. Lastly, on the basis of the results of 16S rRNA sequence analyses and biochemical data, the ancestor of the mesophilic methanococci may have been an autotrophic thermophile.},

Ninety-four percent of the methylreductase activity was recovered in the soluble fraction of cell extracts. The estimated native molecular weight of the enzyme was between 132,000 (standard deviation [SD], 1,200) and 141,000 (SD, 1,200). Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed three protein bands corresponding to molecular weights of 69,000 (SD, 1,200), 42,000 (SD, 1,200), and 33,000 (SD, 1,200) and indicated a subunit configuration of alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 1. As isolated, the enzyme was inactive but could be reductively reactivated with titanium (III) citrate or reduced ferredoxin. ATP stimulated enzyme reactivation and was postulated to be involved in a conformational change of the inactive enzyme from an unready state to a ready state that could be reductively reactivated. The temperature and pH optima for enzyme activity were 60 degrees C and between 6.5 and 7.0, respectively. The active enzyme contained 1 mol of coenzyme F430 per mol of enzyme (Mr, 144,000). The Kms for 2-(methylthio)ethane-sulfonate and 7-mercaptoheptanoylthreonine phosphate were 3.3 mM and 59 microM, respectively.},

Its colonies on mineral agar are translucent, convex, circular with entire margins and yellow to brownish in colour. Cells are gram-positive, non motile and appear as straight cods, normally about 3 µm long. A marked pleomorphism depending on the media was observed. The organism is chemolithoheterotrophic, has a pH optimum of 7.0 and an optimal temperature for growth of 33–40°C; no growth occurs above 45°C. The generation time at optimal conditions is less than 5 h. Cysteine must be supplied in the growth medium. It can act as sole sulfur source. The addition of sulfide accelerates the growth at an optimum concentration of 10-4 to 10-5 molar. A growth factor, not identical with SH-coenzyme M, occurring in anaerobic sewage sludge and yeast extract shows a stimulatory effect. 7.0–8.2{\%} of the total carbon dioxide uptake is assimilated and 11.2{\%} of the energy obtained from the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane is refound in the caloric value of the biomass. 0.01 ppm of dissolved oxygen completely inhibits growth and methane production.

Characterization of a strain, E1-9c(T), associated with uncultured group E1, from a minerotrophic fen is reported. Cells were regular cocci, usually found in pairs, that stained Gram-positive and were resistant to lysis by 0.1 {\%} SDS. Multiple flagella were observed, but motility was not observed in wet mounts. Optimal growth was obtained at moderate temperatures (28-30 degrees C) and slightly acidic pH (5.5). Total Na(+) and NaCl were only tolerated at concentrations less than 100 mM and 0.5 {\%}, respectively, and Na(2)S concentrations above 0.1 mM were inhibitory. H(2)/CO(2) and formate were the only methanogenic substrates used by E1-9c(T); formate concentrations above 50 mM were inhibitory for growth. Vitamins, coenzyme M and acetate (4 mM) were required for growth and the doubling time was about 19 h. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and inferred McrA amino acid sequences showed that E1-9c(T) represented an independent lineage within the order Methanomicrobiales. Physiological and phylogenetic comparisons with different members of the order supported classification of E1-9c(T) in a new genus in the Methanomicrobiales.

abstract = {Methane is produced by various methanogenic bacteria present in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) bioreactors. Methane can be used to predict and improve UASB bioreactor efficiency. The methanogen population in the granules can be influenced by the composition of the substrate. The aim of this study was to fingerprint and identify the methanogens present in three different types of UASB granules that had been used to treat winery, brewery and peach-lye canning effluents. This was done using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA sequence analysis. The DGGE fingerprints obtained from the methanogen reference cultures of Methanosaeta concilii, Methanosaeta thermophila, Methanosarcina barkeri, Methanosarcina mazeii and Methanobacterium formicicum were compared to the DGGE profiles of the Archaea in the different granules. The positions of the DGGE bands that did not correspond well to the bands of the known species were sequenced and compared to sequences available on GenBank using the Blastn search option. The aligned DNA sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. Based on the data obtained, a DGGE marker was constructed which was used to provide a quick method to identify the Archaeal members of the microbial consortium in UASB granules.},

Strain RMAS(T) grew solely on H(2)/CO(2) but required Casamino acids, tryptone, yeast extract or vitamins for growth. Growth of strain RMAS(T) was stimulated by acetate. Cells were non-motile, straight rods (0.5×3.5-10.5 µm) and occurred singly or in pairs. Bundles of fimbriae occurred at both poles of cells and the cell wall was thick (approximately 21 nm, as revealed by ultrathin section electron microscopy). Strain RMAS(T) grew at 45-80 °C (optimum, 70 °C), at pH 5.8-8.7 (optimum, pH 6.9-7.7) and with 0.001-20 g NaCl l(-1) (optimum, 2.5 g NaCl l(-1)). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus $\Delta$H(T) was most closely related to the isolate (95.7 {\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). On the basis of morphological, phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, it is clear that strain RMAS(T) represents a novel species of the genus Methanothermobacter, for which we propose the name Methanothermobacter tenebrarum sp. nov. The type strain is RMAS(T) ( = DSM 23052(T) = JCM 16532(T) = NBRC 106236(T)).},

abstract = {A new acetotrophic marine methane-producing bacterium that was isolated from the methane-evolving sediments of a marine canyon is described. Exponential phase cultures grown with sodium acetate contained irregularly shaped cocci that aggregated in the early stationary phase and finally differentiated into communal cysts that released individual cocci when ruptured or transferred to fresh medium. The irregularly shaped cocci (1.9 +/- 0.2 mm in diameter) were gram negative and occurred singly or in pairs. Cells were nonmotile, but possessed a single fimbria-like structure. Micrographs of thin sections showed a monolayered cell wall approximately 10 nm thick that consisted of protein subunits. The cells in aggregates were separated by visible septation. The communal cysts contained several single cocci encased in a common envelope. An amorphous form of the communal cyst that had incomplete septation and internal membrane-like vesicles was also present in late exponential phase cultures. Sodium acetate, methanol, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine were substrates for growth and methanogenesis; H(2)-CO(2) (80:20) and sodium formate were not. The optimal growth temperature was 35 to 40 degrees C. The optimal pH range was 6.5 to 7.0. Both NaCl and Mg were required for growth, with maximum growth rates at 0.2 M NaCl and 0.05 M MgSO(4). The DNA base composition was 41 +/- 1{\%} guanine plus cytosine. Methanosarcina acetivorans is the proposed species. C2A is the type strain (DSM 2834, ATCC 35395).},

The cells stained gram-negative, were 1.0-2.0 microm in diameter, were lysed by SDS and hypotonic solutions and were flagellated. Motility was not observed. The strain was able to use H2/CO2, 2-propanol/CO2, formate, 2-butanol/CO2 and cyclopentanol/CO2 as substrates for methanogenesis, but did not utilize acetate, ethanol, methanol or methylamines. The optimum temperature and pH were 25-30 degrees C and 6.7-7.2. Analysis of lipid component parts (core lipids, phospholipid polar head groups and glycolipid sugar moieties) showed the characteristic pattern of members of the family Methanomicrobiaceae except for the absence of glucose as a glycolipid sugar moiety. The G+C content of the DNA was 62.2 mol {\%}. Sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA revealed that the strain belonged to the genus Methanoculleus. The strain had DNA-DNA hybridization values of less than 50{\%} with type strains of Methanoculleus species. On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, the name Methanoculleus chikugoensis sp. nov. is proposed for strain MG62T (= JCM 10825T = DSM 13459T). The DNA hybridization study also revealed the close relationships of three species, Methanoculleus olentangyi, Methanoculleus bourgensis and Methanoculleus oldenburgensis, among Methanoculleus species.},

Cells were non-motile rods, 1.3-2.8 $\mu$m long and 0.4-0.7 $\mu$m wide. Coccoid cells were also observed in cultures at the late-exponential phase of growth. Strain MRE50(T) grew at 37-55 °C (optimally at 45 °C), at pH 6-7.8 (optimally at pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0-20 g NaCl l(-1). The isolate utilized H(2)/CO(2) and formate for growth and methane production. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene and the methanogen-specific marker gene mcrA showed that strain MRE50(T) is affiliated with the order Methanocellales, previously known as uncultured archaeal group Rice Cluster I. Based on both 16S rRNA gene and mcrA gene sequences, strain MRE50(T) was related most closely to Methanocella paludicola SANAE(T). Levels of sequence similarity were 92.5 and 86.1 {\%}, respectively, indicating that strains MRE50(T) and Methanocella paludicola SANAE(T) represent different species within the genus Methanocella. In addition, although these strains shared phenotypic properties including cell morphology and substrate utilization, they differed with respect to susceptibility to antibiotics, and temperature and NaCl ranges for growth. Given the phenotypic differences and the distinct phylogenetic placement of the new isolate relative to the type species of the genus Methanocella, strain MRE50(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Methanocella, for which the name Methanocella arvoryzae sp. nov. is proposed.

abstract = {An autotrophic, hyperthermophilic methanogen (M7T) was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal chimney sample collected on the East Pacific Rise at a depth of 2600 m. The coccoid-shaped cells are flagellated and exhibit a slight tumbling motility. The temperature range for growth at pH 6.5 was 49-89 degrees C, with optimum growth at 80 degrees C. The optimum pH for growth was 6.5, and the optimum NaCl concentration for growth was around 25 g l-1. The new isolate used H2 and CO2 as the only substrates for growth and methane production. Tungsten, selenium and yeast extract stimulated growth significantly. In the presence of CO2 and H2, the organism reduced elemental sulphur to hydrogen sulphide. Growth was inhibited by chloramphenicol and rifampicin, but not by ampicillin, kanamycin, penicillin and streptomycin. The G + C content of the genomic DNA was 31 mol{\%}. As determined by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, this organism was closely related to Methanococcus jannaschii strain JAL-1T. However, despite the high percentage of similarity between their 16S rDNA sequences (97.1{\%}), the DNA-DNA hybridization levels between these strains were less than 5{\%}. On the basis of these observations and physiological traits, it is proposed that this organism should be placed in a new species, Methanococcus vulcanius. The type strain is M7T (= DSM 12094T). During the course of this study, the 16S rDNA sequence analysis placed Methanococcus sp. strain AG86T (= DSM 4213T) as a close relative of M. jannaschii strain JAL-1T. However, the weak level of DNA-DNA hybridization with this strain ({\textless} 10{\%}) allowed the proposal that strain AG86T also constitutes a new species, Methanococcus fervens.},

Analysis of the cellular proteins and 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these three strains represented a single novel species that formed a deep branch of the mesophilic methanococci. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the three strains were most closely related to Methanothermococcus okinawensis (95 {\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity).

The trace element tungsten was not required but slightly stimulated the growth of strain P2F9704aT. However, tungsten extended the growth ranges relating to temperature, pH and salt. The sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of strains P2F9704aT and P2F9705 were nearly identical and possessed 99{\textless}1 and 98{\textless}5{\%} similarity to the genes of Methanocalculus pumilus and Methanocalculus halotolerans, respectively.

Methane is produced from H2/CO2, formate, 2-propanol/CO2 and 2-butanol/COz by M. parvurn and M. bavaricum, whereas M. sinense can only utilize Hz/ CO2 and formate. Growth of M. sinense and M. bavaricum is dependent on the presence of clarified rumen fluid. The G + C content of the DNA of the three strains is ranging from 47.7- 53.6 mol{\%} as determined by different methods. A similar, but distinct polar lipid pattern indicates a close relationship between the three Methanocorpusculum species. The polyamine patterns of M. parvurn, M. sinense and M. bavaricum are similar, but distinct from those of other methanogens and are characterized by a high concentration of the otherwise rare 1,3-diaminopropane. Quantitative comparison of the antigenic fingerprint of members of Methanocorpusculum revealed no antigenic relationship with any one of the reference methanogens tested. On the basis of the distant phylogenetic position of M. parvum and the data presented in this paper a new family, the Methanocorpusculaceae faro. nov., is defined.},

abstract = {Four formate-utilizing methanogens were isolated from ovine (strain KM1H5-1P(T)) and bovine (strains AK-87, OCP and ZA-10(T)) rumen contents. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the methanogen strains were found to belong to the order Methanobacteriales in the genus Methanobrevibacter. Strains ZA-10(T) and KM1H5-1P(T) gained energy for growth by the reduction of CO(2) to CH(4) using H(2) or formate exclusively as electron donors. Increasing formate concentrations to 220 mM in batch cultures increased the growth of strain KM1H5-1P(T) but did not affect the growth of strain ZA-10(T). Substrate specificity and resistance to cell-wall lysis supported the affiliation of the strains to the genus Methanobrevibacter. Strains ZA-10(T) and KM1H5-1P(T) showed 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.0 and 98.6 {\%} to their closest recognized relatives, Methanobrevibacter thaueri CW(T) and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium M1(T), respectively. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments indicated that the strains were not affiliated at the species level to their closest recognized relatives, with DNA reassociation values of only 28 {\%} between strains ZA-10(T) and Methanobrevibacter thaueri CW(T) and {\textless}25 {\%} between strains KM1H5-1P(T) and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium M1(T).

Successful isolation required a medium containing inorganic salts, an atmosphere consisting of an 80:20 mixture of hydrogen-carbon dioxide, and incubation temperatures of 65 to 70 C. Isolates of M. thermoautotrophicus were gram-positive, nonmotile, irregularly curved rods which frequently formed long filaments. The organism was found to be an autotroph and a strict anaerobe, and to have a pH optimum of 7.2 to 7.6. The optimal temperature for growth was 65 to 70 C, the maximum being 75 C and the minimum about 40 C. The generation time at the optimum was about 5 hr. The deoxyribonucleic acid of M. thermoautotrophicus had a guanine plus cytosine (GC) content of 52 moles per cent, whereas Methanobacterium sp. strain M.O.H. had a GC content of 38{\%}. When heated, intact ribosomes of Methanobacterium sp. strain M.O.H. were stable up to 55 C and had a Tm of 73 C. In contrast, ribosomes of M. thermoautotrophicus were stable up to 75 C and had a Tm of 82 C. Upon complete thermal denaturation, ribosomes of strain M.O.H. underwent a 59{\%} hyperchromic shift, whereas those of the thermophile showed only a 20{\%} increase in hyperchromicity. Methane formation in cell-free extracts of M. thermoautotrophicus was temperature-dependent and required hydrogen and carbon dioxide; methyl cobalamin served as a methyl donor, and addition of coenzyme M stimulated methanogenesis.},

The cells were irregularly coccoid, non-motile, 1.4+/-0.2 microm in diameter and stained Gram-positive. The catabolic substrates used included dimethylsulfide, methanethiol, methanol and methylated amines, but not acetate, formate, H2/CO2 or a combination of these substrates. When cells grown on dimethylsulfide were transferred to trimethylamine or methanol and vice versa, a lag phase was observed. The same lag phase occurred when cells grown on trimethylamine were transferred to methanol and vice versa, indicating that for each substrate different enzymes were induced. Fastest growth occurred within a temperature range of 30-35 degrees C and a pH of 6.5-7.5. Both Na+ and Mg2+ were required for growth, with maximum growth rates at 200-600 mM Na+ and 20-100 mM Mg2+. The cells exhibited specific growth rates (h-1) of 0.07+/-0.02, 0.15+/-0.04 and 0.18-/+0.05 on dimethylsulfide, methanol and trimethylamine, respectively.

abstract = {A novel methane-producing archaeon, strain NOBI-1(T) was isolated from an anaerobic, propionate-degradation enrichment culture, which was originally obtained from a mesophilic methanogenic sludge digesting municipal sewage sludge. Cells were non-motile, rod-shaped, 0.7-1.0 microm by 2.0 microm, and formed multicellular filaments longer than 8 microm. Growth was observed between 35 and 55 degrees C (optimum 50 degrees C) and pH 6.7 and 8.0 (optimum pH 7.0). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.3 mol{\%}. The strain utilized H(2) and formate for growth and methane production. Based on comparative sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA gene and mcrA gene (encoding the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, a key enzyme in the methane-production pathway), strain NOBI-1(T) was affiliated with the order Methanomicrobiales, but it was significantly distant from any other known species within the order. The most closely related species based on 16S rRNA and mcrA gene sequence similarity were respectively 'Candidatus Methanoregula boonei' (93.7{\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Methanocorpusculum parvum (74.2{\%} deduced McrA amino acid sequence similarity to the type strain). These phenotypic and genetic properties justified the creation of a novel species of a new genus for the strain, for which we propose the name Methanolinea tarda gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Methanolinea tarda is strain NOBI-1(T) (=DSM 16494(T) =JCM 12467(T) =NBRC 102358(T)).},

abstract = {Two methanogenic strains, 8AcT and 6Ac, were isolated from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating beer-manufacture wastewater in Beijing, China. Cells of strains 8AcT and 6Ac were rod-shaped (0.8-1.0 x 3-5 microm) and non-motile, occurring singly or in pairs; however, at high cell density the cells were arranged in long chains within a common sheath. The two strains used acetate exclusively for growth and methane production. The specific growth rate of strain 8AcT was 0.030 h(-1) when growing in acetate (20 mM) at 37 degrees C. The temperature range for growth was 25-45 degrees C, with the fastest growth at 34-37 degrees C. The pH range for growth and methane production was 6.5-9.0, with the fastest growth at pH 7.2-7.6. The G+C content of genomic DNA of strain 8AcT was 55.7 mol{\%}. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity showed that the novel strains clustered with Methanosaeta species; the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain 8AcT and Methanosaeta concilii DSM 3013 and 'Methanosaeta thermophila' DSM 6194 were 92.5 and 87.3 {\%}, respectively. The sequence similarity levels of mcrA, the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, and of the deduced amino acids of mcrA, between strain 8AcT and Methanosaeta concilii DSM 3671T were 36 and 78.9 {\%}, respectively. Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses, the novel species Methanosaeta harundinacea sp. nov. is proposed, with strain 8AcT (= JCM 13211T = CGMCC 1.5026T) as the type strain.},

abstract = {A novel acidiphilic, hydrogenotrophic methanogen, designated strain 6A8(T), was isolated from an acidic (pH 4.0-4.5) and ombrotrophic (rain-fed) bog located near Ithaca, NY, USA. Cultures were dimorphic, containing thin rods (0.2-0.3 $\mu$m in diameter and 0.8-3.0 $\mu$m long) and irregular cocci (0.2-0.8 $\mu$m in diameter). The culture utilized H(2)/CO(2) to produce methane but did not utilize formate, acetate, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, butanol or trimethylamine. Optimal growth conditions were near pH 5.1 and 35 °C. The culture grew in basal medium containing as little as 0.43 mM Na(+) and growth was inhibited completely by 50 mM NaCl. To our knowledge, strain 6A8(T) is one of the most acidiphilic (lowest pH optimum) and salt-sensitive methanogens in pure culture. Acetate, coenzyme M, vitamins and yeast extract were required for growth. It is proposed that a new genus and species be established for this organism, Methanoregula boonei gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Methanoregula boonei is 6A8(T) (=DSM 21154(T) =JCM 14090(T)).},

abstract = {A novel thermophilic, obligately methylotrophic, methanogenic archaeon, strain L2FAW(T), was isolated from a thermophilic laboratory-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor fed with methanol as the carbon and energy source. Cells of strain L2FAW(T) were non-motile, irregular cocci, 0.7-1.5 mum in diameter and usually occurred singly (sometimes forming clusters of two or four cells). The cells stained Gram-negative and lysed immediately in 0.1 {\%} (w/v) SDS. Growth was inhibited by chloramphenicol and tetracycline, but not by penicillin, bacitracin, spectinomycin, vancomycin or kanamycin. Methanol and mono-, di- and trimethylamine were used as substrates, but H2/CO2, formate, acetate, propanol, dimethyl sulfide and methanethiol were not. The temperature range for growth was 42-58 degrees C, with an optimum at 50 degrees C. The fastest growth was observed at a salinity below 100 mM NaCl; no growth occurred above 300 mM NaCl. The optimal pH for growth was 6.5; growth was observed from pH 5 to pH 7.5. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 37.6 mol{\%}. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence and the partial methyl-CoM reductase gene sequence revealed that the organism was phylogenetically closely related to Methanomethylovorans hollandica DMS1T (98 {\%} similarity for the 16S rRNA gene sequence and 91 {\%} similarity for the methyl-CoM reductase gene sequence). The DNA-DNA relatedness between L2FAW(T) and Methanomethylovorans hollandica DMS1T was 46 {\%}. On the basis of these results, strain L2FAW(T) (=DSM 17232T=ATCC BAA-1173T) represents the type strain of a novel species, for which the name Methanomethylovorans thermophila sp. nov. is proposed.},

Cells grew in high-salt minimal medium but growth was stimulated with yeast extract or tryptone.

abstract = {A novel methane-producing archaeon, strain SMSP(T), was isolated from an anaerobic, propionate-degrading enrichment culture that was originally obtained from granular sludge in a mesophilic upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor used to treat a beer brewery effluent. Cells were non-motile, blunt-ended, straight rods, 1.0-2.6 $\mu$m long by 0.5 $\mu$m wide; cells were sometimes up to 7 $\mu$m long. Asymmetrical cell division was observed in rod-shaped cells. Coccoid cells (0.5-1.0 $\mu$m in diameter) were also observed in mid- to late-exponential phase cultures. Growth was observed between 10 and 40 °C (optimum, 30-33 °C) and pH 7.0 and 7.6 (optimum, pH 7.4). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.2 mol{\%}. The strain utilized formate and hydrogen for growth and methane production. Based on comparative sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA and mcrA (encoding the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, a key enzyme in the methane-producing pathway) genes, strain SMSP(T) was affiliated with group E1/E2 within the order Methanomicrobiales. The closest relative based on both 16S rRNA and mcrA gene sequences was Methanoregula boonei 6A8(T) (96.3 {\%} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 85.4 {\%} deduced McrA amino acid sequence similarity). The percentage of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity indicates that strain SMSP(T) and Methanoregula boonei 6A8(T) represent different species within the same genus. This is supported by our findings of shared phenotypic properties, including cell morphology and growth temperature range, and phenotypic differences in substrate usage and pH range. Based on these genetic and phenotypic properties, we propose that strain SMSP(T) represents a novel species of the genus Methanoregula, for which we propose the name Methanoregula formicica sp. nov., with the type strain SMSP(T) (=NBRC 105244(T) =DSM 22288(T)).},

abstract = {Five strains of methanogenic archaea (MT, MS, MM, MSP, ZB) were isolated from permanently and periodically cold terrestrial habitats. Physiological and morphological studies, as well as phylogenetic analyses of the new isolates were performed. Based on sequences of the 16S rRNA and methyl-coenzyme M reductase a-subunit (mcrA) genes all new isolates are closely related to known mesophilic and psychrotolerant methanogens. Both, phylogenetic analyses and phenotypic properties allow to classify strains MT, MS, and MM as members of the genus Methanosarcina. Strain MT is a new ecotype of Methanosarcina mazei, whereas strains MM and MS are very similar to each other and can be assigned to the recently described psychrotolerant species Methanosarcina lacustris. The hydrogenotrophic strain MSP is a new ecotype of the genus Methanocorpusculum. The obligately methylotrophic strain ZB is closely related to Methanomethylovorans hollandica and can be classified as new ecotype of this species. All new isolates, including the strains from permanently cold environments, are not true psychrophiles according to their growth temperature characteristics. In spite of the ability of all isolates to grow at temperatures as low as 1-5 degrees C, all of them have their growth optima in the range of moderate temperatures (25-35 degrees C). Thus, they can be regarded as psychrotolerant organisms. Psychrotolerant methanogens are thought to play an important role in methane production in both, habitats under seasonal temperature variations or from permanently cold areas.},

The previously published characterization of the type strain of M. siciliae was limited to the optimum temperature for growth, and our characterization suggested the species description given below. Cells are irregular, nonmotile, coccoid, and 1.5 to 3 {\{}micro{\}}m in diameter. The catabolic substrates used include methanol, trimethylamine, and dimethyl sulfide, but not H2-CO2, formate, or acetate. Growth is fastest in the presence of 0.4 to 0.6 M Na+, in the presence of 60 to 200 mM Mg2+, at pH 6.5 to 6.8, and at 40{\{}degrees{\}}C. Growth on trimethylamine is stimulated by yeast extract. An electrophoretic analysis confirmed that strain HI350 is closely related to strain T4/MT and indicated that major changes in the intracellular proteins of M. siciliae HI350 occur when the growth substrate is switched between dimethyl sulfide and trimethylamine.},

abstract = {Methanogenic archaea conserve energy for growth by reducing some one- and two-carbon compounds to methane and concomitantly generating an ion motive force. Growth of Methanosarcina acetivorans on carbon monoxide (CO) is peculiar as it involves formation of, besides methane, formate, acetate and methylated thiols. It has been argued that methane formation is partially inhibited under carboxidotrophic conditions and that the other products result from either detoxification of CO or from bypassing methanogenesis with other pathways for energy conservation. To gain a deeper understanding of the CO-dependent physiology of M. acetivorans we analyzed metabolite formation in resting cells. The initial rates of methane, acetate, formate, and dimethylsulfide formation increased differentially with increasing CO concentrations but were maximal already at the same moderate CO partial pressure. Strikingly, further increase of the amount of CO was not inhibitory. The maximal rate of methane formation from CO was approximately fivefold lower than that from methanol, consistent with the previously observed significant downregulation of the energy converting sodium-dependent methyltransferase. The rate of dimethylsulfide formation from CO was only 1-2{\%} of that of methane formation under any conditions tested. Implications of the data presented for previously proposed pathways of CO utilization are discussed.},

Based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence, the strain belongs to the order Methanococcales within the genus Methanocaldococcus, with approximately 95 {\%} sequence similarity to Methanocaldococcus jannaschii as its closest relative. Cells of the novel organism stained Gram-negative and appeared as regular to irregular cocci possessing more than 50 polar flagella. These cell appendages mediated not only motility but also adherence to abiotic surfaces and the formation of cell-cell contacts. The new isolate grew at 55-90 °C, with optimum growth at 80 °C. The optimum NaCl concentration for growth was 2.5 {\%} (w/v), and the optimal pH was 6.5. The cells gained their energy exclusively by reduction of CO(2) with H(2). Selenate, tungstate and yeast extract stimulated growth significantly. The genome size was determined to be in the range 1.8-2.0 kb, and the G+C content of the genomic DNA was 30 mol{\%}. Despite being physiologically nearly identical to the other members of the genus Methanocaldococcus, analysis of whole-cell proteins revealed significant differences. Based on the results from phylogenetic, morphological and protein analyses, we conclude that the novel strain represents a novel species of the genus Methanocaldococcus, for which the name Methanocaldococcus villosus sp. nov. is proposed (type strain KIN24-T80(T) = DSM 22612(T) = JCM 16315(T)).},

The cells were non-motile, Gram-negative and rod-shaped (1.8-2.4 microm long by 0.3-0.6 microm wide). Growth of strain SANAET was observed at 25-40 degrees C, with an optimum temperature range for growth of 35-37 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 6.5-7.8, with an optimum at pH 7.0. The salinity range for growth was 0-1 g NaCl l(-1) (0-17 mM). The isolate was able to utilize H2/CO2 and formate for growth and methane production. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.6 mol{\%}. Based on comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain SANAET was affiliated with a clone lineage of the Archaea, Rice Cluster I (RC-I), placing it between the orders Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales within the class 'Methanomicrobia'. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain SANAET and members of Methanosarcinales were in the range 80.0-82.8 {\%}, and those between the strain and members of Methanomicrobiales ranged from 77.5 to 82.4 {\%}. In addition to 16S rRNA gene analysis, sequence analysis of the mcrA gene (encoding the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, a key enzyme in the methane production pathway) also showed that strain SANAET was affiliated with the RC-I lineage. Here, we propose the name Methanocella paludicola gen. nov., sp. nov. for the isolate, the first of the RC-I lineage. The type strain is SANAET (=JCM 13418T=NBRC 101707T=DSM 17711T).

abstract = {Strain H2-LR(T), a 5-18 micro m long and 0.7 micro m wide filamentous, mesophilic, moderately halophilic, non-motile hydrogenotrophic methanogen, was isolated from marine sediment of Aarhus Bay, Denmark, 1.7 m below the sediment surface. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene comparison with sequences of known methanogens, strain H2-LR(T) could be affiliated to the genus Methanobacterium. The strain forms a distinct line of descent within this genus, with Methanobacterium oryzae (95.9 {\%} sequence identity) and Methanobacterium bryantii (95.7 {\%} sequence identity) as its closest relatives. The 16S rRNA-based affiliation was supported by comparison of the mcrA gene, which encodes the alpha-subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase. Strain H2-LR(T) grew only on H(2)/CO(2). The DNA G+C content is 34.9 mol{\%}. Optimum growth temperature was 45 degrees C. The strain grew equally well at pH 7.5 and 8. No growth or methane production was observed below pH 5 or above pH 9. Strain H2-LR(T) grew well within an NaCl concentration range of 100 and 900 mM. No growth or methane production was observed at 1 M NaCl. At 50 mM NaCl, growth and methane production were reduced. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the isolate is proposed to represent a novel taxon within the genus Methanobacterium, namely Methanobacterium aarhusense sp. nov. The type strain is H2-LR(T) (=DSM 15219(T)=ATCC BAA-828(T)).},

abstract = {Fast protein liquid chromatography of cell extract from methanol- or acetate-grown Methanosarcina thermophila resolved two peaks of CO dehydrogenase activity. The activity of one of the CO dehydrogenases was sixfold greater in acetate-grown compared with methanol-grown cells. This CO dehydrogenase was purified to apparent homogeneity (70 mumol of methyl viologen reduced per min per mg of protein) and made up greater than 10{\%} of the cellular protein of acetate-grown cells. The native enzyme (Mr 250,000) formed aggregates with an Mr of approximately 1,000,000. The enzyme contained five subunits (Mrs 89,000, 71,000, 60,000, 58,000, and 19,000), suggesting a multifunctional enzyme complex. Nickel, iron, cobalt, zinc, inorganic sulfide, and a corrinoid were present in the complex. The UV-visible spectrum suggested the presence of iron-sulfur centers. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum contained g values of 2.073, 2.049, and 2.028; these features were broadened in enzyme that was purified from cells grown in the presence of medium enriched with 61Ni, indicating the involvement of this metal in the spectrum. The pattern of potassium cyanide inhibition indicated that cyanide binds at or near the CO binding site. The properties of the enzyme imply an involvement in the dissimilation of acetate to methane, possibly by cleavage of acetate or activated acetate.},

abstract = {Three novel strains of methylotrophic methanogens were isolated from Skan Bay, Alaska, by using anaerobic cultivation techniques. The water was 65 m deep at the sampling site. Strains AK-4 (=OCM 774), AK-5T (=OCM 775T=DSM 17273T) and AK-9 (=OCM 793) were isolated from the sulfate-reducing zone of the sediments. Each of the strains was a non-motile coccus and occurred singly. Cells grew with trimethylamine as a catabolic substrate and strain AK-4 could also catabolize methanol. Yeast extract and trypticase peptones were not required for growth, but their addition to the culture medium slightly stimulated growth. Each of the strains grew at temperatures of 5-28 degrees C; they were slight halophiles and grew fastest in the neutral pH range. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain AK-4 was most closely related to Methanosarcina baltica. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed 88 {\%} relatedness, suggesting that strain AK-4 represents a novel strain within this species. Strains AK-5T and AK-9 had identical 16S rRNA gene sequences that were most closely related to the sequence of Methanococcoides burtonii (99.8 {\%} sequence similarity). DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed that strains AK-5T and AK-9 are members of the same species (88 {\%} relatedness value), but strain AK-5T had a DNA-DNA relatedness value of only 55 {\%} to Methanococcoides burtonii. This indicates that strains AK-5T and AK-9 should be considered as members of a novel species in the genus Methanococcoides. We propose the name Methanococcoides alaskense sp. nov., with strain AK-5T (=OCM 775T=DSM 17273T) as the type strain.},

abstract = {We continuously fed an anaerobic chemostat with synthetic wastewater containing glucose as the sole source of carbon and energy to study the effects of temperature on the microbial community under hyperthermophilic (65-80 degrees C) conditions. Methane was produced normally up to 77.5 degrees C at a dilution rate of 0.025 d(-1). However, the concentration of microorganisms and the rate of gas production decreased with increasing operation temperature. The microbial community in the chemostat at various temperatures was analyzed based on the 16S rRNA gene using molecular biological techniques including clone library analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Aceticlastic methanogens related to Methanosarcina thermophila were detected at 65 degrees C and hydrogenotrophilic methanogens related to Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus were the dominant methanogens between 70 degrees C to 77.5 degrees C. Bacteria related to Clostridium stercorarium and Thermoanaerobacter subterraneus comprised the dominant glucose-fermenting bacteria at temperatures of 65 degrees C and above, respectively. Bacteria related to Thermacetogenium phaeum and to Tepidiphilus margaritifer and Petrobacter succinatimandens were the dominant acetate-oxidizing bacteria at 70 degrees C and at 75-77.5 degrees C, respectively. The results suggested that, at temperatures of 70 degrees C and above, methane production via the aceticlastic pathway was negligible and indirect methanogenesis from acetate was dominant. Since acetate oxidation is a rate limiting step and a higher temperature favors the hydrolysis and acid formation, a two stage fermentation process, acidogenic and methanogenic fermentation stages operated under different temperatures, should be more suitable for the thermophilic anaerobic treatment at temperatures above 65 degrees C.},

abstract = {Methanosarcina is the only acetate-consuming genus of methanogenic archaea other than Methanosaeta and thus is important in methanogenic environments for the formation of the greenhouse gases methane and carbon dioxide. However, little is known about isotopic discrimination during acetoclastic CH(4) production. Therefore, we studied two species of the Methanosarcinaceae family, Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanosarcina acetivorans, and a methanogenic rice field soil amended with acetate. The values of the isotope enrichment factor (epsilon) associated with consumption of total acetate (epsilon(ac)), consumption of acetate-methyl (epsilon(ac-methyl)) and production of CH(4) (epsilon(CH4)) were an epsilon(ac) of -30.5 per thousand, an epsilon(ac-methyl) of -25.6 per thousand, and an epsilon(CH4) of -27.4 per thousand for M. barkeri and an epsilon(ac) of -35.3 per thousand, an epsilon(ac-methyl) of -24.8 per thousand, and an epsilon(CH4) of -23.8 per thousand for M. acetivorans. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of archaeal 16S rRNA genes indicated that acetoclastic methanogenic populations in rice field soil were dominated by Methanosarcina spp. Isotope fractionation determined during acetoclastic methanogenesis in rice field soil resulted in an epsilon(ac) of -18.7 per thousand, an epsilon(ac-methyl) of -16.9 per thousand, and an epsilon(CH4) of -20.8 per thousand. However, in rice field soil as well as in the pure cultures, values of epsilon(ac) and epsilon(ac-methyl) decreased as acetate concentrations decreased, eventually approaching zero. Thus, isotope fractionation of acetate carbon was apparently affected by substrate concentration. The epsilon values determined in pure cultures were consistent with those in rice field soil if the concentration of acetate was taken into account.},

abstract = {A new mesophilic methanogenic bacterium was isolated from a sewage sludge digestor. The cells were irregular cocci (diameter, 0.5 to 2.0 pm) and occurred singly or in small aggregates. Adjacent cells did not appear to touch, even in aggregates. This bacterium was not motile and did not possess flagella. Colonies appearing after 1 week of incubation were white and 1 mm in diameter. Older colonies were yellow and up to 4 mm in diameter. The organism used H2-C02 or formate as an energy source. Acetate and either yeast extract or Trypticase peptone were required for growth. The optimum pH for growth was between 6.5 and 7.0. The NaCl requirement for methanogenesis was less than 0.2 g/liter. The deoxyribonucleic acid base composition was 52 mol{\%} guanine plus cytosine. This isolate is named Methanogeniurn aggregans sp. nov., and the type strain (strain MSt) has been deposited in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen as strain DSM 3027.},

abstract = {Contamination of groundwater by chlorinated solvents such as carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and chloroform (CHCl3) is a widespread problem. The cell exudates from the methanogen Methanosarcina thermophila are active in the degradation of CCl4 and CHCl3. This research was performed to characterize these exudates. Examination of the influence of pH indicated that activity was greater under alkaline conditions. Rapid CCl4 degradation occurred from 35-65 degrees C, with first-order degradation rate coefficients increasing as temperature increased. It was found that proteins were not responsible for CCl4 degradation. The active agents in the cell exudates were {\textless}10 kDa in size, with degradation activity present in both 1-10 kDa and {\textless}1 kDa size ranges. Upon purification of the {\textless}10 kDa size range of the cell exudates on a C(18) chromatography column, 17 fractions (out of 100) degraded {\textgreater}50{\%} of the added CCl4 in 8 h. These 17 fractions were pooled into three samples based on their elution time from the C(18) column. One of these pooled samples contained elevated levels of cobalt, zinc, and iron, at 2, 3, and 13 times the levels measured in similarly fractionated and pooled samples of medium, respectively. The UV-visible spectrum of this pooled sample had an absorption maximum at 560-580 nm, which is similar to the absorption maxima of heme (approximately 550 and 575 nm). The two other pooled samples contained elevated levels of zinc at 11 and 22 times the concentration measured in similarly fractionated and pooled samples of medium, respectively, and also contained very low levels of nickel, cobalt, and iron. This research suggests that the cell exudates from M. thermophila contain porphorinogen-type molecules capable of dechlorination, possibly excreted corrinoids, hemes, and zinc-containing molecules.},

All M. concilii oligonucleotide probes (designated MS1, MS2, and MS5) hybridized specifically with the target DNA, but MS5 was the most specific M. concilii oligonucleotide probe. Methanosarcina barkeri oligonucleotide probes (designated MB1, MB3, and MB4) hybridized with different Methanosarcina species. The MB4 probe specifically detected Methanosarcina barkeri, and the MB3 probe detected the presence of all mesophilic Methanosarcina species. These new oligonucleotide probes facilitated the identification, localization, and quantification of the specific relative abundance of M. concilii and Methanosarcina barkeri, which play important roles in methanogenesis. The combined use of fluorescent in situ hybridization with confocal scanning laser microscopy demonstrated that anaerobic granule topography depends on granule origin and feeding. Protein-fed granules showed no layered structure with a random distribution of M. concilii. In contrast, a layered structure developed in methanol-enriched granules, where M. barkeri growth was induced in an outer layer. This outer layer was followed by a layer composed of M. concilii, with an inner core of M. concilii and other bacteria.},

@article{Andrews2001,
abstract = {The influence of environmental conditions on the biological transformation of a contaminant must be well understood to optimize remediation processes. One factor that impacts the biological transformation of carbon tetrachloride (CT) is elemental iron (Fe0). Previous research has shown that Fe0 increases the methanogenic CT degradation rate by providing H2 for cell growth and dechlorination. As Fe0 oxidizes it also increases the pH and Fe2+ levels, which may also impact the biological transformation of CT. Experiments were performed with Methanosarcina thermophila to investigate the influence of these factors on CT degradation. The transformation of CT and CF was greatly influenced by pH, with the rate of CT and CF degradation increasing with increasing pH. After 6 h, {\textgreater} 90{\%} of the CT had been degraded in the treatments containing cells at a pH of 8.5, whereas only about 51{\%} of the CT had been degraded in similar treatments at a pH of 5.5. Fe2+ did not significantly influence the degradation of CT; however, 60{\%} less CF was formed in systems containing cells+Fe2+ than in systems containing cells only. In addition. Fe2+ promoted rapid transformation of CF when added to treatments containing cells. The product distribution after 9 days in all systems containing cells was very similar, with 98.04 +/- 5.46{\%} (two-sided 95{\%} confidence interval) of the originally fed CT present as soluble products. These results show that pH and Fe2+ influence the degradation of CT and CF, although transiently. Because the residence time of contaminants in Fe0 barriers varies with the thickness of the barrier, it is likely that this influence will be important for some flow-through systems. This implies that a combined Fe0/organism remediation system may have previously unrealized advantages (due to pH and Fe2+ changes).},

abstract = {Three novel DNA-binding proteins with apparent molecular masses of 7, 10 and 30 kDa have been isolated from the hyperthermophilic methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri. The proteins were identified using a blot overlay assay that was modified to emulate the high ionic strength intracellular environment of M.kandleri proteins. A 7 kDa protein, named 7kMk, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. As indicated by CD spectroscopy and computer-assisted structure prediction methods, 7kMk is a substantially alpha-helical protein possibly containing a short N-terminal beta-strand. According to analytical gel filtration chromatography and chemical crosslinking, 7kMk exists as a stable dimer, susceptible to further oligomerization. Electron microscopy showed that 7kMk bends DNA and also leads to the formation of loop-like structures of approximately 43.5 +/- 3.5 nm (136 +/- 11 bp for B-form DNA) circumference. A topoisomerase relaxation assay demonstrated that looped DNA is negatively supercoiled under physiologically relevant conditions (high salt and temperature). A BLAST search did not yield 7kMk homologs at the amino acid sequence level, but based on a multiple alignment with ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) transcriptional regulators, fold features and self-association properties of 7kMk we hypothesize that it could be related to RHH proteins.},

The complete set of kinetic parameters, including maximum specific growth rate [mu]max, half saturation constant KS, acetate threshold concentration and cell growth yield YX/S, were determined for six Methanosarcina strains newly isolated from full-scale reactors and the type strain Methanosarcina thermophila TM-1T. The kinetic experiments were performed in media supplemented with acetate and activated carbon at the optimum growth temperatures of the individual strains, 50-55°C. The [mu]max values of the isolates were in the range of 0.044-0.064 h-1, the KS ranged from 6.5 to 24.7 mM acetate and the threshold for acetate utilization from 0.11 to 0.40 mM. The cell growth yields of the strains were between 0.78 and 2.97 g dry weight cells mol-1 acetate. The six isolates exhibited significantly higher [mu]max and had higher affinity to acetate than the type strain M. thermophila TM-1T. Generally, the affinities of thermophilic Methanosarcina strains tested in this study cover a similar range to those reported in the literature for mesophilic Methanosarcina spp. with acetate as substrate. The strains isolated from plants treating mixtures of animal manures and industrial organic wastes had higher affinity for acetate and lower thresholds than strains isolated from reactors operating solely on manures.},

abstract = {All methanogenic Archaea examined to date rely on methanogenesis as their sole means of energy conservation. Among these are ones that use carbon monoxide as a growth substrate, producing methane via a pathway that involves hydrogen as an intermediate. To further examine the role of hydrogen in this process, we tested the ability of Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A, a metabolically versatile methanogen devoid of significant hydrogen metabolism, to use CO as a growth substrate. M. acetivorans grew on CO to high cell densities (approximately 1 x 10(8) per ml) with a doubling time of approximately 24 h. Surprisingly, acetate and formate, rather than methane, were the major metabolic end products as shown by 13C NMR studies and enzymatic analysis of culture supernatants. Methane formation surpassed acetate/formate formation only when the cultures entered stationary growth phase, strongly suggesting that M. acetivorans conserves energy by means of this acetogenic and formigenic process. Resting cell experiments showed that methane production decreased linearly with increasing CO partial pressures, consistent with inhibition of methanogenesis by CO. Transposon-induced M. acetivorans mutants with lesions in the operon encoding phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase failed to use either acetate or CO as growth substrates, indicating that these enzymes are required for both aceticlastic methanogenesis and carboxidotrophic acetogenesis. These findings greatly extend our concept of energy conservation and metabolic versatility in the methanogenic Archaea.},

The enrichment cultures were characterized at each subculturing step by 16S rRNA gene Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. About 90{\%} of spiked polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were stoichiometrically converted into di- and tri-chlorinated congeners by each enriched culture via dechlorination of flanked para chlorines and ortho-flanked meta chlorines. A 2-fold increase in PCB-dechlorination rate, the disappearance of lag phase, as well as a remarkable increase of sulfate consumption and a decline of methanogenic activity, were observed throughout subculturing. A reduction of complexity of the archaeal community, which was composed by Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales, was also observed as a result of culture enrichment. The bacterial community included members of the Alpha, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon divisions of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Chloroflexi. Two sequence phylotypes related to the genus Sulforovum and the species Desulfococcus multivorans and two Chloroflexi enriched throughout subculturing, thus suggesting that these bacteria were involved in PCB dechlorination in the marine sediments of Brentella canal.},

abstract = {Minerotrophic fen peatlands are widely distributed in northern latitudes and, because of their rapid turnover of organic matter, are potentially larger sources of atmospheric methane than bog peatlands per unit area. However, studies of the archaeal community composition in fens are scarce particularly in minerotrophic sites. Several 16S rRNA-based primer sets were used to obtain a broad characterization of the archaeal community in a minerotrophic fen in central New York State. A wide archaeal diversity was observed in the site: 11 euryarchaeal and 2 crenarchaeal groups, most of which were uncultured. The E1 group, a novel cluster in the order Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosaetaceae were the codominant groups in all libraries and results of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. Given its abundance and potential hydrogenotrophic methane contribution, the E1 group was targeted for culture attempts with a low-ionic-strength medium (PM1). Initial attempts yielded Methanospirillum-dominated cultures. However, by incorporating a T-RFLP analysis as a quick selection tool for treatments and replicates, we were able to select an enrichment dominated by E1. Further dilutions to 10(-9) and tracking with T-RFLP yielded a strain named E1-9c. E1-9c is a novel coccoid hydrogenotrophic, mesophilic, slightly acidophilic methanogen and is highly sensitive to Na(2)S concentrations (requires {\textless}0.12 mM for growth). We propose E1-9c as the first representative of a novel genus in the Methanomicrobiales order.},

abstract = {A methanogenic bacterium, present in bovine rumen contents at concentrations of approximately 2 x 10(8) cells per ml, has been isolated in pure culture. The organism is a strictly anaerobic, weakly motile, nonsporeforming, gram-negative rod (0.7 mu x 1.5 to 2.0 mu) with rounded ends. There is a single polar flagellum. The organism grows at temperatures between 30 and 45 C, with an optimum at 40 C, and at pH values between 5.9 and 7.7, with optimal growth between pH 6.1 and 6.9. Of the 17 substrates tested, only formate and H(2) plus CO(2) supported growth. An unidentified, heat-stable factor(s) was required by the organism. The factor, which was not one of the common ones, was present in rumen fluid, mixed rumen bacteria, and yeast extract. On the basis of colony morphology, Gram reaction, and motility, the organism is classified as a new species of methanogenic bacterium, and the name Methanobacterium mobilis sp. n. is proposed.},

These methanogens were exclusively acetotrophic and had a characteristic sheathed structure. The DNA base compositions of the strains which we studied ranged from 50.3 to 54.3 mol{\%} guanine plus cytosine. The thermophilic strains often had phase-refractive gas vesicles inside their cells. Denaturing electrophoresis of proteins showed that the mesophilic and thermophilic Mefhanothrix strains formed two distinct groups and that there were differences in protein patterns between the groups. The difference between the thermophiles and mesophiles was also verified by comparing partial 16s rRNA sequences (ca. 30 base differences in ca. 540 bases). On the basis of our results, we propose the name Methanothrix thenophila for the three thermophilic strains. The type strain of M. thermophila is strain P, (= DSM 6194). We also propose that the name Methanothrix thenoacetophila (‘LMethanosaeta thermoaceto- phila”), which was given to strain 2-517 (type strain), should be rejected because of its description, which was based on an enrichment culture, was inadequate.

abstract = {Hemoglobins are ubiquitous in Eukarya and Bacteria but, until now, have not been found in Archaea. A phylogenetic analysis of the recently revealed microbial family of globin-coupled heme-based sensors suggests that these sensors descended from an ancient globin-only progenitor, or a protoglobin (Pgb). Here, we report the discovery and characterization of two Pgbs from the Archaea: ApPgb from the obligately aerobic hyperthermophile Aeropyrum pernix, and MaPgb from the strictly anaerobic methanogen Methanosarcina acetivorans. Both ApPgb and MaPgb bind molecular oxygen, nitric oxide, and carbon monoxide by means of a heme moiety that is coordinated to the protein through the F8 histidine (histidine 120). We postulate that these archaeal globins are the ancestors of contemporary hemoglobins.},

abstract = {Distillery wastewater from awamori making was anaerobically treated for one year using thermophilic upflow anaerobic filter (UAF) reactors packed with pyridinium group-containing nonwoven fabric material. The microbial structure and spatial distribution of microorganisms on the support material were characterized using molecular biological methods. The reactor steadily achieved a high TOC loading rate of 18 g/l/d with approximately 80{\%} TOC removal efficiency when non-diluted wastewater was fed. The maximum TOC loading rate increased to 36 g/l/d when treating thrice-diluted wastewater. However, the TOC removal efficiency and gas evolution rate decreased compared with that when non-diluted wastewater was used. Methanogens closely related to Methanosarcina thermophila and Methanoculleus bourgensis and bacteria in the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were predominant methanogens and bacteria in the thermophilic UFA reactor, as indicated by 16S rRNA gene clone analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results showed that a large quantity of bacterial cells adhered throughout the whole support, and Methanosarcina-like methanogens existed mainly in the relative outside region while Methanoculleus cells were located in the relative inner part of the support. The support material used proved to be an excellent carrier for microorganisms, and a UAF reactor using this kind of support can be used for high-rate treatment of awamori/shochu distillery wastewater.},

abstract = {Methanosarcina acetivorans was cultured in the presence of CdCl(2) to determine the metal effect on cell growth and biogas production. With methanol as substrate, cell growth and methane synthesis were not altered by cadmium, whereas with acetate, cadmium slightly increased both, growth and methane rate synthesis. In cultures metabolically active, incubations for short-term (minutes) with 10 µM total cadmium increased the methanogenesis rate by 6 and 9 folds in methanol- and acetate-grown cells, respectively. Cobalt and zinc but not copper or iron also activated the methane production rate. Methanogenic carbonic anhydrase and acetate kinase were directly activated by cadmium. Indeed, cells cultured in 100 µM total cadmium removed 41-69{\%} of the heavy metal from the culture and accumulated 231-539 nmol Cd/mg cell protein. This is the first report showing that (i) Cd(2+) has an activating effect on methanogenesis, a biotechnological relevant process in the bio-fuels field; and (ii) a methanogenic archaea is able to remove a heavy metal from aquatic environments.},

abstract = {A morphologically distinct, filamentous methan- ogen was isolated from hindguts of the subterranean ter- mite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) (Rhinotermitidae), wherein it was part of the microbiota colonizing the hindgut wall. Individual filaments of strain RFM-3 were 0.23–0.28 µm in diameter and usually {\textgreater} 50 µm in length and aggregated into flocs that were often ≥ 0.1 mm in di- ameter. Optimal growth of strain RFM-3 was obtained at pH 7.0–7.2 and 30°C with a yeast-extract-supplemented, dithiothreitol-reduced medium in which cells produced stoichiometric amounts of methane from H2 + CO2. The morphology and gram-positive staining reaction of strain RFM-3, as well as its resistance to cell lysis by various chemical agents and its restriction to H2 + CO2 as an en- ergy source, suggested that it was a member of the Me- thanobacteriaceae. The nucleotide sequence of the SSU- rRNA-encoding gene of strain RFM-3 confirmed this af- filiation and also supported its recognition as a new species of Methanobrevibacter, for which the epithet filiformis is herewith proposed. Although M. filiformis was one of the dominant methanogens in R. flavipes collected from Woods Hole (Mass., USA), cells of similar morphology were not consistently observed in R. flavipes collected from differ- ent geographical locations.

abstract = {Conventional studies of the optimum growth conditions for methanogens (methane-producing, obligate anaerobic archaea) are typically conducted with serum bottles or bioreactors. The use of microfluidics to culture methanogens allows direct microscopic observations of the time-integrated response of growth. Here, we developed a microbioreactor (microBR) with approximately 1-microl microchannels to study some optimum growth conditions for the methanogen Methanosaeta concilii. The microBR is contained in an anaerobic chamber specifically designed to place it directly onto an inverted light microscope stage while maintaining a N2-CO2 environment. The methanogen was cultured for months inside microchannels of different widths. Channel width was manipulated to create various fluid velocities, allowing the direct study of the behavior and responses of M. concilii to various shear stresses and revealing an optimum shear level of approximately 20 to 35 microPa. Gradients in a single microchannel were then used to find an optimum pH level of 7.6 and an optimum total NH4-N concentration of less than 1,100 mg/liter ({\textless}47 mg/liter as free NH3-N) for M. concilii under conditions of the previously determined ideal shear stress and pH and at a temperature of 35 degrees C.},
